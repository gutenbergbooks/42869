<h2>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p>So far as Dr. Montessori's experiments contain the affirmation
of a new doctrine and the illustration of a new
method in regard to the teaching of Grammar, Reading
and Metrics, the following pages are, we hope, a faithful
rendition of her work. But it is only in these respects that
the chapters devoted to these subjects are to be considered
a translation. It will be observed that Dr. Montessori's
text is not only a theoretical treatise but also an actual
text-book for the teaching of Italian grammar, Italian reading
and Italian metrics to young pupils. Her exercises
constitute a rigidly "tested" material: her Italian word
lists are lists which, in actual practise, have accomplished
their purpose; her grammatical categories with their relative
illustration are those actually mastered by her Italian
students; her reading selections and her metrical analyses
are those which, from an offering doubtless far more extensive,
actually survived the experiment of use in class.</p>

<p>It is obvious that no such value can be claimed for any
"translation" of the original material. The categories of
Italian grammar are not exactly the categories of English
grammar. The morphology and, to a certain extent, the
syntax of the various parts of speech differ in the two languages.
The immediate result is that the Montessori material
offers much that is inapplicable and fails to touch on
much that is essential to the teaching of English grammar.
The nature and extent of the difficulties thus arising are
more fully set forth in connection with specific cases in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
our text. Suffice it here to indicate that the English material
offered below is but approximately "experimental,"
approximately scientific. The constitution of a definitive
Montessori material for English grammar and the definitive
manner and order of its presentment must await the
results of experiments in actual use. For the clearer orientation
of such eventual experiments we offer, even for
those parts of Italian grammar which bear no relation to
English, a virtually complete translation of the original
text; venturing meanwhile the suggestion that such studies
as Dr. Montessori's treatise on the teaching of Italian noun
and adjective inflections&mdash;entirely foreign to English&mdash;may
prove valuable to all teachers of modern languages.
While it might seem desirable to isolate such superfluous
material from the "English grammar" given below, we
decided to retain the relative paragraphs in their actual
position in the Italian work, in order to preserve the literal
integrity of the original method. Among our additions
to the text we may cite the exercises on the possessive pronouns&mdash;identified
by Dr. Montessori with the possessive
adjectives&mdash;the interrogatives and the comparison of adjectives
and adverbs.</p>

<p>Even where, as regards morphology, a reasonably close
adaptation of the Italian material to English uses has been
possible, it by no means follows that the pedagogical problems
involved remain the same. The teaching of the relative
pronoun, for instance, is far more complicated in English
than in Italian; in the sense that the steps to be taken
by the child are for English more numerous and of a
higher order. Likewise for the verb, if Italian is more
difficult as regards variety of forms, it is much more simple
as regards negation, interrogation and progressive action.
We have made no attempt to be consistent in adapting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
translation to such difficulties. In general we have treated
the parts of speech in the order in which they appear in
the Italian text, though actual experiment may prove that
some other order is desirable for the teaching of English
grammar. The English material given below is thus in
part a translation of the original exercises in Italian, in
part new. In cases where it proved impossible to utilize
any of the Italian material, an attempt has been made to
find sentences illustrating the same pedagogical principle
and involving the same number and character of mental
processes as are required by the original text.</p>

<p>The special emphasis laid by Dr. Montessori upon selections
from Manzoni is due simply to the peculiar conditions
surrounding the teaching of language in Italy, where general
concepts of the national language are affected by the
existence of powerful dialects and the unstable nature of
the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of the national literature.
We have made no effort to find a writer worthy of
being set up as a like authority, since no such problem
exists for the American and English public. Our citations
are drawn to a large extent from the "Book of Knowledge"
and from a number of classics. Occasionally for
special reasons we have translated the Italian original.
The chapter on Italian metrics has been translated entire
as an illustration of method; whereas the portion relating
to English is, as explained below, entirely of speculative
character.</p>

<p>To Miss Helen Parkhurst and Miss Emily H. Greenman
thanks are due for the translation of the chapters on
Arithmetic, Geometry, and Drawing.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a><br /><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TRANSITION FROM THE MECHANICAL
TO THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT
OF LANGUAGE</div>


<p>In the "Children's Houses" we had reached a stage
of development where the children could write words and
even sentences. They read little slips on which were
written different actions which they were to execute, thus
demonstrating that they had understood them. The material
for the development of writing and reading consisted
of two alphabets: a larger one with vowels and consonants
in different colors, and a smaller one with all the
letters in one color.</p>

<p>(In English, to diminish the phonetic difficulties of the
language, combinations of vowels and consonants, known
as phonograms, are used. The phonograms with few exceptions
have constant sounds and little attention is paid to
the teaching of the separate values of the different letters:
not until the child has built up his rules inductively does
he realize the meaning of separate vowel symbols.)</p>

<p>However, the actual amount of progress made was not
very precisely ascertained. We could be sure only that
the children had acquired the mechanical technique of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
writing and reading and were on the way to a greater
intellectual development along these lines. Their progress,
however extensive it may have been, could be called
little more than a foundation for their next step in
advance, the elementary school. What beyond all question
was accomplished with the little child in the first
steps of our method was to establish the psycho-motor
mechanism of the written word by a slow process of maturation
such as takes place in the natural growth of articulate
speech; in other words, by methodically exercising
psycho-motor paths.</p>

<p>Later on the child's mind is able to make use of the
successive operations performed with the written language
which has been thus built up by the child as a matter of
mechanical execution (writing) and to a certain extent
of intelligent interpretation (reading). Normally this is
an established fact at the age of five. When the child begins
to think and to make use of the written language to
express his rudimentary thinking, he is ready for elementary
work; and this fitness is a question not of age
or other incidental circumstance but of mental maturity.</p>

<p>We have said, of course, that the children stayed in the
"Children's House" up to the age of seven; nevertheless
they learned to write, to count, to read, and even to do a
certain amount of simple composition. It is clear, accordingly,
that they had gone some distance in the elementary
grade as regards both age and educational development.
However, what they had actually accomplished
beyond the mechanical technique of writing was more or
less difficult to estimate. We can now say that our later
experiments have not only clarified this situation, but
enabled us to take the children much farther along than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
before.</p>

<p>This only proves, however, that on beginning elementary
grade work we did not depart from the "Children's
House" idea; on the contrary we returned to it to
give distinct realization to the nebulous hopes with which
our first course concluded. Hence the "Children's
House" and the lower grades are not two distinct things
as is the case with the Fröbel Kindergarten and the ordinary
primary school&mdash;in fact, they are one and the same
thing, the continuation of an identical process.</p>

<p>Let us return then to the "Children's House" and
consider the child of five and one-half years. To-day in
those "Children's Houses" which have kept up with the
improvements in our method the child is actually
started on his elementary education. From the second
alphabet of the "Children's House" we go on to a third
alphabet. Here the movable letters are a great deal
smaller and are executed in model hand-writing. There
are twenty specimens of each letter, whereas formerly
there were but four; furthermore, there are three complete
alphabets, one white, one black, and one red. There
are, therefore, sixty copies of each letter of the alphabet.
We include also all the punctuation marks: period,
comma, accents (for Italian), apostrophe, interrogation
and exclamation points. The letters are made of plain
glazed paper.</p>

<p>The uses of this alphabet are many; so before we stop
to examine them let us look somewhat ahead. Everybody
has recognized the naturalness of the exercise, used in the
"Children's House," where the children placed a card
bearing the name of an object on the object referred to.
This was the first lesson in reading. We could see that
the child knew how to read as soon as he was able to identify
the object indicated on the card. In schools all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the world a similar procedure would, I imagine, be considered
logical. I suppose that in all the schools where
the objective method is used much the same thing is done;
and this is found to be not a hindrance but a help to the
child in learning the names of objects. As regards the
teaching of the noun, accordingly, we have been using
methods already in use&mdash;the objective method, with practical
exercises. But why should we restrict such methods
to the noun? Is the noun not just as truly a <em>part of
speech</em> as the adjective, or the verb? If there is a method
by which the knowledge of a noun is made easy, may there
not be similar ways of facilitating the learning of all the
other parts of speech (article, adjective, verb, pronoun, adverb,
interjection, conjunction, and preposition)?</p>

<p>When a slip with the interpreted word is placed on the
object corresponding to it, the children are actually distinguishing
the noun from all the other parts of speech.
They are learning intuitively to define it. The first step
has thus been taken into the realm of grammar. But if
this "reading" has brought the child directly into word
<em>classification</em>, the transition has not been for him so abrupt
as might at first appear. The child has built <em>all</em> his words
with the movable alphabet, and he has, in addition, <em>written</em>
them. He has thus traversed a two-fold preparatory exercise
involving, first, the analysis of the sounds and, second,
the analysis of the words in their meaning. In fact,
we have seen that, as the child reads, it is his discovery
of the tonic accent that brings him to recognize the word.
The child has begun to analyze not only the sounds and
accent but also the form of the word.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>How absurd it would seem to suggest a study of phonology
and morphology in a nursery with four-year-old
children as investigators! Yet our children have accomplished
this very thing! The analysis was the means of
attaining the word. It was what made the child able to
write without effort. Why should such a procedure be
useful for single words and not so for connected discourse?
Proceeding to the classification of words by distinguishing
the noun from all other words, we have really advanced
into the analysis of connected speech, just as truly as,
by having the sand-papered letters "touched" and the
word pronounced, we took the first step into the analysis
of words. We have only to carry the process farther and
perhaps we shall succeed in getting the analysis of whole
sentences, just as we succeeded in getting at the composition
of words&mdash;discovering meanwhile a method which
will prove efficacious in leading the child to write his
thoughts more perfectly than would seem possible at such
a tender age.</p>

<p>For some time, then, we have been actually in the field
of grammar. It is a question simply of continuing along
the same path. The undertaking may indeed seem hazardous.
Never mind! That "awful grammar," that
horrible bugaboo, no less terrible than the frightful
method, once in use, of learning to read and write, may
perhaps become a delightful exercise, a loving guide to
lead the child along pleasant pathways to the <em>discovery</em>
of things he has <em>actually performed</em>. Yes, the child will
suddenly find himself, one day, in possession of a little
composition, a little "work of art," that has issued from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
his own pen! And he will be as happy over it as he was
when for the first time words were formed by his tiny
hands!</p>

<p>How different grammar will seem to the young pupil,
if, instead of being the cruel assassin that tears the sentence
to pieces so that nothing can be understood, it becomes
the amiable and indispensable help to "the construction
of connected discourse"! It used to be so easy
to say: "The sentence is written! Please leave it
alone!" Why put asunder what God has joined? Why
take away from a sentence its meaning, the very thing
which gave it life? Why make of it a mere mass of senseless
words? Why spoil something already perfect just for
the annoyance of plunging into an analysis which has no
apparent purpose? Indeed, to impose upon people who
can already read the task of reducing every word to its
primal sounds, would be to demand of them an effort of
will so gigantic that only a professional philologist could
apply himself to it with the necessary diligence, and then
only because he has his own particular interests and aims
involved in such work. Yet the four-year-old child, when
he passes from those meaningless sounds to the composition
of a whole, which corresponds to an idea and represents
a useful and wonderful conquest, is just as attentive
as the philologist and perhaps even more enthusiastic.
He will find the same joy in grammar, if, starting from
analyses, it gains progressively in significance, acquiring,
step by step, a greater interest, working finally up to a
climax, up to the moment, that is, when the finished sentence
is before him, its meaning clear and <em>felt</em> in its subtlest
essences. The child has created something beautiful,
full grown and perfect at its birth, not now to be tampered
with by anybody!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The analysis of sounds which, in our method, leads to
spontaneous writing, is not, to be sure, adapted to all ages.
It is when the child is four or four and a half, that he
shows the characteristically childlike passion for such
work, which keeps him at it longer than at any other age,
and leads him to develop perfection in the mechanical aspect
of writing. Similarly the analytical study of parts
of speech, the passionate lingering over words, is not for
children of all ages. It is the children between five and
seven who are the <em>word-lovers</em>. It is they who show a predisposition
toward such study. Their undeveloped minds
can not yet grasp a complete idea with distinctness. They
do, however, understand <em>words</em>. And they may be entirely
carried away by their ecstatic, their tireless interest
in the <em>parts</em> of speech.</p>

<p>It is true that our whole method was born of heresy.
The first departure from orthodoxy was in holding that
the child can best learn to write between the ages of four
and five. We are now constrained to advance another
heretical proposition: children should begin the study of
grammar between the ages of five and a half and seven
and a half, or eight!</p>

<p>The idea that analysis must be preceded by construction
was a matter of mere prejudice. Only things produced
by nature must be analyzed before they can be understood.
The violet, for instance, is found perfect in nature.
We have to tear off the petals, cut the flower into
sections to see how it grew. But in making an artificial
violet we do just the opposite. We prepare the stems
piece by piece; then we work out the petals, cutting, coloring,
and ironing them one by one. The preparation of
the stamens, even of the glue with which we put the whole
together, is a distinct process. A few simple-minded people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with a gift for light manual labor, take unbounded
delight in these single operations, these wonderfully varied
steps which all converge to the creation of a pretty
flower; the beauty of which depends on the amount of
patience and skill applied to the work on the individual
parts.</p>

<p>Analysis, furthermore, is involved quite as much in
building as in taking to pieces. The building of a house
is an analytical process. The stones are treated one by
one from cellar to roof. The person who puts the house
together knows it in its minutest details and has a far
more accurate idea of its construction than the man who
tears it down. This is true, first, because the process of
construction lasts much longer than that of demolition:
more time is spent on the study of the different parts.
But besides this, the builder has a point of view different
from that of the man who is destroying. The sensation of
seeing a harmonious whole fall into meaningless bits has
nothing in common with the alternating impulses of hope,
surprise or satisfaction which come to a workman as he
sees his edifice slowly assuming its destined form.</p>

<p>For these and still other reasons, the child, when interested
in words at a certain age, can utilize grammar
to good purpose, dwelling analytically upon the various
parts of speech according as the processes of his inner
spiritual growth determine. In this way he comes to own
his language perfectly, and to acquire some appreciation
of its qualities and power.</p>

<p>Our grammar is not a book. The nouns (names),
which the child was to place on the objects they referred
to as soon as he understood their meaning, were written
on cards. Similarly the words, belonging to all the other
parts of speech, are written on cards. These cards are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the same dimensions: oblongs (5 × 3-1/2 cmm.) of different
colors: black for the noun; tan for the article;
brown for the adjective; red for the verb; pink for the
adverb; violet for the preposition; yellow for the conjunction;
blue for the interjection.</p>

<p>These cards go in special boxes, eight in number. The
first box has two compartments simply; the second, however,
three; the third, four; and so on down to the eighth,
which is divided into nine. One wall in each section is
somewhat higher than the others. This is to provide
space for a card with a title describing the contents of the
section. It bears, that is, the name of the relative part
of speech. The title-card, furthermore, is of the same
color as that used for the part of speech to which it refers.
The teacher is expected to arrange these boxes so as to
provide for the study of two or more parts of speech.
However, our experiments have enabled us to make the
exercises very specific in character; so that the teacher
has at her disposal not only a thoroughly prepared material
but also something to facilitate her work and to
check up the accuracy of it.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WORD STUDY</div>


<p>When a little child begins to read he shows a keen desire
to learn words, words, words! Indeed in the "Children's
House" we had that impressive phenomenon of
the children's tireless reading of the little slips of paper
upon which were written the names of objects.</p>

<p>The child must acquire his word-store for himself.
The peculiar characteristic of the child's vocabulary is its
meagerness. But he is nearing the age when he will need
to express his thoughts and he must now acquire the material
necessary for that time. Many people must have
noticed the intense attention given by children to the conversation
of grown-ups when they cannot possibly be understanding
a word of what they hear. They are trying
to get hold of <em>words</em>, and they often demonstrate this fact
by repeating joyously some word which they have been
able to grasp. We should second this tendency in the
child by giving him an abundant material and by organizing
for him such exercises as his reactions clearly
show us are suitable for him.</p>

<p>The material used in our system not only is very
abundant, but it has been dictated to us by rigid experimentation
on every detail. However, the same successive
choices of material do not appear among the children as a
whole. Indeed their individual differences begin to assert
themselves progressively at this point in their education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The exercises are easy for some children and very
hard for others, nor is the order of selection the same
among all the children. The teacher should know this material
thoroughly. She should be able to recognize the
favorable moment for presenting the material to the child.
As a matter of fact, a little experience with the material
is sufficient to show the teacher that the educational facts
develop spontaneously and in such a way as to simplify
the teacher's task in a most surprising manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suffixes and Prefixes</span></h3>

<p>Here we use charts with printed lists of words which
may be hung on the wall. The children can look at them
and also take them in their hands.</p>

<div class='hang1'><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ghiotto</i> ("<i>sweet-tooth</i>"): ghiottone, ghiottoncello, ghiottaccio,

<div class='hang1'><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vecchio</i> (<i>old man</i>): vecchietto, vecchione, vecchiaccio, vecchissimo</div>

<div class='hang1'><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cieco</i> (<i>blind</i>): ciechino, ciechetto, ciecolino, ciecone, ciecaccio</div>

<p>Note:&mdash;The rôle of augmentative and diminutive suffixes in
English is vastly less important than in Italian. Here are a
few specimens:</p>

<div class='list1'>
<i>lamb</i>&mdash;lambkin<br />
<i>duck</i>&mdash;duckling<br />
<i>bird</i>&mdash;birdling<br />
<i>nest</i>&mdash;nestling<br />
<i>goose</i>&mdash;gosling<br />
<i>mouse</i>&mdash;mousie<br />
<i>girl</i>&mdash;girlie<br />
<i>book</i>-booklet<br />
<i>brook</i>&mdash;brooklet<br />
<i>stream</i>&mdash;streamlet<br />
<i>poet</i>&mdash;poetaster<br />
</div>

<p>The child's exercise is as follows: he composes the first
word in any line with the alphabet of a single color (e.g.,
black). Next underneath and using the alphabet of the
same color, he repeats the letters in the second word which
he sees also in the first. But just as soon as a letter
changes he uses the alphabet of another color (e.g., red).
In this way the root is always shown by one color, the
suffixes by another; for example:&mdash;</p>

<div class='list1'>
buono<br />
buon<i>uccio</i><br />
buon<i>ino</i><br />
buon<i>issimo</i><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>For English:</i></p>

<div class='list1'>
stream<br />
stream<i>let</i><br />
lamb<br />
lamb<i>kin</i><br />
</div>

<p>Then the child chooses another word and repeats the
same exercise. Often he finds for himself words not included
in the list which is given him.</p>

<p>In the following chart the suffixes are constant while
the root varies. Here the suffix changes the meaning of
the word. From the original meaning is derived the
word for a trade, a place of business, an action, a collective
or an abstract idea. Naturally, the child does not realize
all this at first but limits himself merely to building the
words mechanically with the two alphabets. Later on,
however, as grammar is developed, he may return to the
reading of these charts, which are always at his disposal,
and begin to realize the value of the differences.</p>

<p>The children read one word at a time and try to reproduce
it from memory, distinguishing through the two
alphabets the two words of which each one is composed:</p>

<div class='list1'>

bianco <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">spino</i><br />

</div>

<p><i>For English:</i></p>

<div class='list1'>
moon <em>light</em><br />

</div>

<p>In the following chart the words are grouped in families.
This chart may be used by children who are already
well advanced in the identification of the parts of
speech. All the words are derived from some other more
simple word which is a root and of which the other words,
either by suffix or prefix, are made up. All these roots
are primitive words which some day the child may look
for in a group of derivatives; and when he finds them he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
will realize that the primitive word is a noun, adjective,
or a verb, as the case may be, that it is the word which
contains the simplest idea, and so the derivatives may be
nouns, adjectives, verbs or adverbs.</p>

<p>On these charts appear various word-families. The
teacher is thus spared the trouble of looking them up.
Furthermore the child will some day be able to use them
by himself. The exercises based on these are still performed
with two different alphabets of different color so
that the child can tell at a glance which is the root word.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ARTICLE AND NOUN</div>

<blockquote><p>[Note:&mdash;The English language presents a far simpler situation
than the Italian as regards the agreement of article and
adjectives. Gender itself being, in the case of English nouns,
more a matter of logical theory than of word-ending, adjectival
agreement in the formal sense in practically unknown to English
grammar. Likewise the formation of the plural is much
simpler in English than in Italian, where the singular and
plural word-endings are closely associated with gender. It is
a question, in fact, whether the whole subject of the gender of
English nouns should not be taken up somewhat later in connection
with the pronouns, where English shows three singular
forms masculine, feminine, neuter (him, her, it) as against
the Italian two, masculine and feminine (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lo</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la</i>, plural <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">li</i>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">le</i>,
etc.). Signora Montessori's discussion of the situation in
Italian still remains instructive to the teacher of English as
an illustration of method. We retain her text, accordingly, in
its entirety.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr.</span>]</p></blockquote>


<p>As we have already said, the words chosen for grammatical
study are all printed on small rectangular pieces
of cardboard. The little cards are held together in packages
by an elastic band and are kept in their respective
boxes. The first box which we present has two compartments.
In the holders at the back of each compartment
are placed the cards which show the part of speech to be
studied, in this case <em>article</em> and <em>noun</em>. The article
cards are placed in the article compartment and the nouns
in the noun compartment. When the children have finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
their exercise they replace the cards&mdash;the nouns
in the place for the nouns and the articles in the place for
the articles. If the words <em>article</em> and <em>noun</em> are not a
sufficient guide for the child, the color at least will make
the task easy. In fact the child will place the black cards
for the noun in the compartment indicated by the black
guide-card (marked <em>noun</em>); the tan cards for the article
with the tan guide-card (marked <em>article</em>). This exercise
recalls the child's experience with the alphabet boxes,
where one copy of each letter is pasted to the bottom of
the box as a guide for the child in replacing the other
letters. The child begins to speak of the <em>article-section</em>,
the <em>noun-section</em>, and the <em>article-cards</em> and <em>noun-cards</em>. In
so doing he begins to <em>distinguish</em> between the parts of
speech. The material must be prepared very accurately
and in a definitely determined quantity. For the first exercise,
the children are given boxes with the articles and
nouns shuffled together in their respective compartments.
But there must be just enough articles of each gender to
go with the respective nouns. The child's task is to put
the right article in front of the right noun&mdash;a long and
patient research, which, however, is singularly fascinating
to him.</p>

<p>We have prepared the following words. We should recall,
however, that the cards are not found in the boxes in
this order, but are mixed together&mdash;the articles shuffled
in their box-section and the nouns in theirs.</p>

<p>(We suggest as a corresponding English exercise the
introduction of the <em>indefinite</em> article. This substitution
involves four processes against the eight of the Italian
exercise. The use of <em>an</em> before a vowel is quite analogous
to the problem of the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">l'</i> and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gl'</i>. However
the theoretical distinction between the definite and indefinite
article, as regards meaning, is reserved by Signora
Montessori to a much later period, though the practical
distinction appear in the earliest <cite>Lessons and Commands</cite>.&mdash;Tr.)</p>

<img src="images/fp_024.jpg" width="600" height="401" alt="two childrens working at a table" />
<span class="caption">One of the first steps in grammar. The children are deeply interested in placing the correct articles and nouns
together. (<cite>A Montessori School in Italy.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>The child tries to combine article and noun and puts
them side by side on his little table. In this exercise he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
guided by sound just as he was in building words with
the movable alphabet. There the child's first step was to
find relationships between real objects and the linguistic
sounds corresponding to them. Now he sees suddenly revealed
to him hitherto unsuspected relationships between
these sounds, these words. To have an empirical way of
demonstrating and testing these relationships, to practise
very thoroughly on two kinds of words, suddenly brought
forth into systematic distinctness from the chaos of words
in his mind, offers the child not only a necessary exercise
but the sensation of relief which comes from satisfying an
inner spiritual need. With the most intense attention
he persists to the very end of the exercise and takes great
pride in his success. The teacher as she passes may
glance about to see if all the cards are properly placed,
but the child, doubtless, will call her to admire or verify
the work that he has done, before he begins to gather together,
first, all the articles, then, all the nouns, to return
them to their boxes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fp_025.jpg" width="600" height="393" alt="set of cards" />
<span class="caption">Grammar Boxes. The one on the left is for articles and nouns only; the one on the right, for articles, nouns,
and adjectives.</span>
</div>

<p>This is the first step; but he proceeds with increasing
enthusiasm to set the words in his mind "in order,"
thereby enriching his vocabulary by placing new acquisitions
in an already determined place. Thus he continues
to construct, with respect to exterior objects, an inner
spiritual system, which had already been begun by his
sensory exercises.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Singular and Plural</span></h3>

<p>The exercises on the number and gender of nouns are
done without the help of the boxes. The child already
knows that those words are articles and nouns, so we give
him now small groups of forty cards (nouns and articles)
held together by an elastic band. In each one, the group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
(tied separately) of the ten singular nouns serves as the
guide for the exercise. These nouns are arranged in a
column on the table, one beneath the other, and the other
cards, which are shuffled, must be placed around this first
group in the right order. There are two more cards of
different colors on which the words <em>singular</em> and <em>plural</em>
respectively are written; and these are placed at the top
of the respective columns. We have prepared four series
of ten nouns in alphabetical order. In this way four
children may do the exercise at the same time and by exchanging
material they come in contact with a very considerable
number of words.</p>

<p>This is the way the cards should finally be arranged in
the four different exercises:</p>

<p>Finally there are three series of nouns in four forms:
Singular and Plural, Masculine and Feminine. Each
group has eighty cards counting both nouns and articles,
and the ten singular masculines in the guiding group are
kept together, apart from the others. The title cards
(twelve in number) are <em>singular</em> and <em>plural</em> and for each
of them is a card marked <em>masculine</em> and a card marked
<em>feminine</em>. The following is the order of the material
when properly arranged by the child:</p>

<p>Occasionally class exercises are used in our schools for
the four forms of the Italian noun, masculine and feminine,
singular and plural. They take the form almost
of a game, which the children find amusing. A child for
instance distributes around the class all the plural nouns.
Then he reads aloud a noun in the singular. The child
who holds the corresponding plural answers immediately.
The same thing is next done for masculine and feminine,
and, finally, for all four forms at once.</p>

<p>When these exercises have become familiar to the child,
others somewhat more difficult may be presented. These
new ones comprise: nouns which change form completely
as they change gender and of which, so far, only
the most familiar examples (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">babbo</i>, "father," <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mamma</i>,
"mother," etc.) have been given (Series A); nouns in
which the form is the same in the singular of both genders
(Series B); those in which both genders have a common
form in the singular and a common form in the
plural (Series C); nouns which have only one form for
both singular and plural (Series D); nouns where the
same form appears in both genders but with a different
meaning (Series E); finally, nouns which change gender
as they pass from the singular to the plural (Series
F).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Singular and Plural in English</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Translator's Note</span>:&mdash;While the formation of the
English plural does not present the complications of gender
that appear in Italian, the phonetic adaptations required
by the plural ending -s along with certain orthographical
caprices and historical survivals of the language,
result in a situation somewhat more complex than
treated by Signora Montessori. In fact, her analysis
of the Italian plural requires eight word-lists, while English
requires at least fourteen, not including the question
of foreign nouns. The special stress on the article is
hardly necessary in English. An analogous treatment for
English would be somewhat as follows:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>All these groups of words in their order are reproduced
in special booklets which the children may take home and
read. In actual practise such books have proved both
convenient and necessary. The children generally spend
much time on them and delight in reading the words over
and over in the order in which they themselves have discovered
them in the card exercise. This recalls and fixes
their own ideas, inducing a sort of inner maturation which
is often followed by the spontaneous discovery of grammatical
laws on the relations of nouns, or by a lively interest
which throws the children into exclamations or laughter
as they observe what great differences of meaning are
sometimes caused by a very slight change in the word.
At the same time these simple exercises, so fruitful in results,
may be used for work at home and well meet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
demands for something to do with which children are
continually assailing their parents. For homework we
have prepared alphabets where the letters are printed in
type-writing order. With them the child can compose
words, or later, sentences, at the same time becoming familiar
with the alphabet arrangement of standard typewriters.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LESSONS&mdash;COMMANDS</div>


<p>The first lessons in grammar which I gave to children
go back fully sixteen years. I first attempted the education
of defectives in the "Scuola Magistrale Ortofrenica"
in Rome in the year 1899 following a course of lectures
I had given to teachers in the normal school of our
capital. In this experiment I went far enough with primary
work to prepare some of the defective children for
successful examinations in the public schools. A very
brief and incomplete summary of my pedagogical studies
delivered in the teacher's courses is given in the appendix
to this volume.</p>

<p>The teaching of grammar was not at that time so complete
as it has since been made in my work with normal
children; even so it was a marked success. Grammar was
actually <em>lived</em> by the children, who became deeply interested
in it. Even those wretched children who came, like
rubbish thrown out of the public schools, directly off the
street or from the insane asylums, passed delightful half
hours of joyous laughter over their exercises in grammar.
Here are some excerpts from the old pamphlet of 1900
giving an idea of the didactic material which was then
used and some notion of a lesson on nouns. "As each
word is read or written for every object-lesson, for every
action, printed cards are being assembled which will later
be used to make clauses and sentences with words that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
may be moved about just as the individual letters were
moved about in making the words themselves. The simple
clauses or sentences should refer to actions performed
by the children. The first step should be to bring two or
more words together: e.g., <em>red-wool</em>, <em>sweet-candy</em>, <em>four-footed
dog</em>, etc. Then we may go on to the sentence itself:
<em>The wool is red;</em> <em>the soup is hot;</em> <em>the dog has four feet;</em>
<em>Mary eats the candy</em>, etc. The children first compose the
sentences with their cards; then they copy them in their
writing books. To facilitate the choice of the cards, they
may be arranged in special boxes: for instance, one box
may be labeled <em>noun;</em> or the boxes may be distinguished
thus: <em>food</em>, <em>clothing</em>, <em>animals</em>, <em>people</em>, etc. There should
be a box for <em>adjectives</em> with compartments for colors,
shapes, qualities, etc. There should be another for <em>particles</em>,
with compartments for articles, conjunctions, prepositions,
etc. A box should be reserved for <em>actions</em>, with
the label <em>verbs</em> above it, containing compartments
for the infinitive, present, past and future. The children
gradually learn by practise to take their cards from the
boxes and put them back in their proper places. They
soon learn to know their "word boxes" and they readily
find the cards they want among the <em>colors</em>, <em>shapes</em>, <em>qualities</em>,
etc., or among <em>animals</em>, <em>foods</em>, etc. Ultimately the
teacher will find occasion to explain the meaning of the
big words written at the top of the drawers, <em>noun</em>, <em>adjective</em>,
<em>verb</em>, etc., and this will be the first step into the subject
of <em>grammar</em>.</p>


<h3>NOUNS</h3>

<p>We may call persons and objects by their <em>name</em>, their
<em>noun</em>. People answer if we call them, so do animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Inanimate objects, however, never answer, because they
cannot; but if they could they would. For example, if
I say <em>Mary</em>, Mary answers; if I say <em>peas</em>, the peas do not
answer, because they cannot. You children <em>do</em> understand
when I call an object and you <em>bring</em> it to me. I
say, for example, <em>book</em>, <em>beans</em>, <em>peas</em>. If I don't tell you
the name of the object, you don't understand what I am
talking about; because every object has a different name.
This <em>name</em> is the word that stands for the object. This
name is a <em>noun</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever I mention a noun to you, you understand
immediately the object which the noun represents:
tree, chair, pen, book, lamb, etc. If I do not give this
noun, you don't know what I am talking about; for, if I
say simply <em>bring me ... at once, I want it</em>, you do not
know what I want, unless I tell you the name of the object.
Unless I give you the <em>noun</em>, you do not understand.
Thus every object is represented by a word which is its
<em>name;</em> and this name is a <em>noun</em>. To understand whether
a word is a noun or not, you simply ask: <em>Is it a thing?
Would it answer if I spoke to it?</em> or <em>Could I carry it to
the teacher?</em> For instance, <em>bread:</em> yes, bread is an object;
<em>table:</em> yes, it is an object; <em>conductor:</em> yes, the conductor
would answer, if I were to speak to him.</p>

<p>Let us look through our cards now. I take several
cards from different boxes and shuffle them. Here is the
word <em>sweet</em>. Bring me <em>sweet!</em> Is there anything to answer
when I call <em>sweet?</em> But you are bringing me a piece
of candy! I didn't say <em>candy:</em> I said <em>sweet</em>. And now
you have given me <em>sugar!</em> I said <em>sweet!</em> <em>Sweet</em>, you see,
is not an object You cannot guess what I have in mind
when I say <em>sweet</em>. If I say <em>candy</em>, <em>sugar</em>, then you understand
what I want, what object I am thinking about, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the words <em>candy</em>, <em>sugar</em>, stand for objects. Those
words are <em>nouns</em>."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This summary, however, fails to give a real idea of the
success of these lessons. When I said with a tone of
decision, as if I could not think of the necessary word,
"Bring me&mdash;bring me&mdash;bring me&mdash;," the children
would gather round me, looking fixedly at my lips, like
so many little dogs, waiting for me to throw something
for them to fetch. They were in fact ready to run and
get what I wanted. But the word refused to come.
"Bring me&mdash;, bring me&mdash;." Finally in great impatience
I cried, "But bring it to me quick&mdash;I want it."
Then their faces lit up and they would laughingly cry,
"But bring you what? What is it you want? What
shall we bring you?"</p>

<p>This was the real lesson on the noun, and when, after
great difficulty, the word "<em>sweet</em>" came out, the children
would run and bring me every possible object that was
sweet. I would refuse each one in turn. "No, I didn't
ask for candy! No, I didn't ask for sugar!" The children
would look at the object they had in their hands, half
laughing, half puzzled and beginning to realize that <em>sweet</em>
was not a <em>name</em>, that it was not a <em>noun</em>. These first lessons,
which seemed something like commands that needed
the help of the children to express themselves, brought the
children to understand some part of speech, while evoking,
at the same time, vivid and interesting scenes. They
furnished the original impulse to the development we have
reached to-day in our lessons on grammar. For such lessons
we have adopted the term "commands." But with
normal children these "commands" were gradually multiplied
and evolved. They are no longer entrusted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
teacher's ingenuity; nor are they dependent solely upon
her dramatic sense&mdash;something essential if she is to stimulate
the weak nervous reactions of little defectives and
so gain and hold their attention. The "commands" to-day
are written and may be read. They are combined
with the card-exercises where the cards are read in silence
and interpreted through actions&mdash;a method which grew
spontaneously and with such great success from the work
in the "Children's House." That is why, to-day, we
speak in the elementary courses of "reading commands"
or even of "writing commands."</p>

<p>The study of grammar has finally been arranged in a
methodical series of exercises and the material has been
prepared after careful and rigid experiment. Those who
read this method will get a clear idea of the teacher's task.
She has a material ready for use. She need not bother
to compose a single sentence nor to consult a single program.
The objects at her disposal contain all that is
necessary. She need know simply what they are and
how they are to be used. The lessons which she must
give are so simple, and require so few words, that they
become lessons rather of gesture and action than of words.
It must be borne in mind, further, that the work is not as
uninteresting as would appear from this arid summary.
The actual school is a real intellectual laboratory, where
the children work all the time and by themselves. After
the material has been presented to them, they <em>recognize</em> it
and like to hunt for it. They know how to find for themselves
the precious objects which they want to use. They
often exchange materials and even lessons with other children.
The few lessons the teacher gives connect, as it
were, a system of live wires, which set in motion activities
quite disproportionate to the energy expended in the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
act she performs. She pushes, so to speak, a button
and here a bell rings, there a light goes on, there a machine
begins to buzz. Very often the teacher sees a whole
week go by without any need of intervention on her part.</p>

<p>And yet what delicacy and tact are necessary properly
to "offer" this material, to give in an interesting way a
lesson calculated to exert a direct action upon the child's
spiritual activity! How skilful we must be to leave all
the child's spontaneous impulses free to develop themselves,
to keep careful watch over so many different individual
impulses! This we must do if we are to "keep
the lamp burning"! When, for example, on passing a
table where the child has analyzed a sentence with the
colored cards, the teacher shifts about, as if in play, one of
the little slips, not only must she be possessed of the
psychological insight necessary for intervening in this
child's work at the proper time, but she must also have in
mind the grammatical rule of which she wishes to give the
child his first intuition. It follows that every single act
of the teacher, however insignificant apparently, is, like
the acts of the priest in the service, of the greatest importance,
and should come from a consciousness thoroughly
awake, and full of potentiality. Instead of giving out
what she has in herself, the teacher must bring out the
full possibilities of the children.</p>

<p>The teacher's extrinsic preparation is a matter of thorough
acquaintance with the material. It should be so
much a part of her that she knows at once what is needed
for each individual case as soon as it arises. Actual
practise soon develops this skill.</p>

<p>The exercises are performed with these little packages
of specially prepared cards. The most important problem
(for Italian grammar) is in the <em>agreements;</em> the agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of article and noun, as we have already shown, the
agreement of noun and adjective, and later on of pronoun
and verb, and pronoun and noun. There are two kinds
of exercises, which we have termed respectively "analyses"
and "commands."</p>

<p>The <em>commands</em> involve both work done by the teacher
and exercises performed by the children. The purpose
here is to clarify the meanings of words and often to suggest
a <em>practical</em> interpretation of them. This <em>explanation</em>
is followed by an exercise of the children themselves,
who in turn practically interpret the meaning of one or
more sentences written on a card which they read just as
they did in the first exercises of reading in the "Children's
House." On this card are the words which the
teacher has just explained. In our experiments we gave
these lessons immediately after "silence" just as we did
for reading in the "Children's House." All the children,
however, do not necessarily take part in these executions&mdash;oftenest
it is only a group of children, sometimes
one child alone, again, at other times, almost all of them.
If possible the commands are given in another room, while
the other children continue their work in the large hall.
If this is not possible it takes place in the same room.
These commands might be called "an introduction to
dramatic art," for right there little dramatic scenes full
of vivacity and interest are "acted out." The children
are singularly delighted in working for the one exact "interpretation"
which a given word requires.</p>

<p>The <em>analyses</em>, on the other hand, are of quite different
character. "Analysis" is done at the table. It is work
which requires quiet and concentration. While the command
gives the <em>intuition</em>, the analysis provides for the
<em>maturation</em> of the idea. The grammar boxes are used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
these exercises. In a larger compartment which each
box contains, are placed several slips bearing a printed
sentence; for example, <em>Throw down your handkerchief</em>.
The child draws a slip and places it to one side on the
table. Then he takes from the different boxes the colored
slips corresponding to the different words in the sentence
and places them side by side one after the other. In this
way he composes the entire sentence: <em>Throw down your
handkerchief</em>. The child is actually doing here a very
simple thing: he is merely translating into colored cards
the sentence which is printed on his slip. He composes
this sentence in the same way in which he has already
composed words with the moveable alphabet. But here
the exercise is even more simple because the child need not
remember the sentence, for it is there right before his eyes.
His attention must be concentrated on other facts, so that
all intellectual effort in the composition of the sentence
itself is eliminated. The child has to note the colors and
the position of the cards in the different boxes, since he
must take the cards now from the noun box, now from the
adverb box, now from that of the preposition, etc.; and
the colors together with the position (each section has a
title, as we have already seen) strengthen his consciousness
of a <em>classification</em> of words according to <em>grammar</em>.</p>

<p>But what really makes this exercise in analysis so interesting
is the teacher's repeated permutation of the different
cards. As she goes by a table she changes, as
though in fun, the position of a card, and in this way
provokes the intuition of grammatical rules and definitions.
Indeed, when she takes out the card, which refers
to some new part of the exercise, the remaining sentence
with its changed meaning emphasizes the function of the
part of speech which has been moved. The effect shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a distant analogy to the light that pathology and vivisection
throw on physiology. An organ which fails in its
function illustrates exactly that function, for never does
one realize the precise use of an organ more clearly than
when it has lost its power of functioning. Furthermore
the removal of the words demonstrates that the meaning
of the sentence is not given by the word alone but by the
<em>order</em> of the word in the sentence, and this makes a great
impression on the child. He sees the same cards first
in a chaotic mass and then in an orderly arrangement.
What was first a collection of meaningless words has suddenly
become the expression of a <em>thought</em>.</p>

<p>From now on the child begins to experience a keen interest
in the <em>order</em> of words. The meaning, the only thing
the child is after, is no longer hidden in confusion. He
begins to enjoy subtle permutations, changes which, without
destroying the expression of a thought, obscure its
clarity, complicate it, or make it "sound wrong." It is
here that the teacher must have at her fingertips the rules
governing the position of the various parts of speech.
This will give her the necessary "lightness of touch,"
perhaps even the opportunity of making some brilliant
little explanation, some casual observation, which may
suddenly develop in the child a profound "grammatical
insight." When the child has understood this he will become
a deep "strategist" in mobilizing, disposing and
moving about these cards which express <em>thought;</em> and if he
really succeeds in mastering this secret, he will not be
easily satiated with so fascinating an exercise. No one
but a child would ever have the patience to study grammar
so profoundly and at such length. This subtle work is,
after all, not so easy for the teacher. That is why the material
must be such as to suggest each step in detail. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
teacher should be relieved as much as possible of the labor
of preparation and research: for her delicate work of <em>intervention</em>
is a task hard enough in itself. In preparing
this material we have worked for her: we have acted as
the workmen who produce the various objects necessary
to life; she has but to "live" and "make live." This
will show still more clearly how far from truth is the
modern conception of pedagogy which attempts to realize
its desire for freedom in the school by saying to the
teacher, "Try to respond to the needs of the pupils without
being conscious of your authority over them." When
we ask a teacher to respond to the needs of the inner life
of man, we are asking a great deal of her. She will never
be able to accomplish it, unless we have first done something
for her by giving her all that is necessary to that
end. Here is our material:&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Commands on Nouns</span></h3>

<div class='subsection'>"CALLING"</div>

<div>
Call loudly:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mary! Lucy! Ethel!</span><br />
<br />
Later call again:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blonde! Beautiful! Good!</span><br />
<br />
Call:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peter! bring a chair.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">George! bring a cube.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Louis! get a frame.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charles! Charles! quick! bring me the ... bring it to me, quick, quick.</span><br />
<br />
Call slowly this way:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come! Come! give me a kiss&mdash;please, come!</span><br />
<br />
Then say:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mary! come! give me a kiss!</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>These commands lend themselves to a little dramatic
scene. It is really a sort of play, which the children recite.</p>

<p>The tendency to recitation and to imitation is very
strong and often well developed at the age of five years.
Little children experience a singular fascination in pronouncing
the words with sentiment and in accompanying
them with gestures. One can hardly imagine the simplicity
of the little dramatic acts which interest the five
year old child. Nothing but actual experiment could possibly
have revealed it to us. One day, in fact, our little
children were invited to be present at a dramatic entertainment
given by the older children of the Public Schools.
They followed it with really surprising interest. However,
they remembered only three words of the play they
had heard; but with these three words they made up a
little dramatic action of their own, which they repeated
over and over again the following day.</p>

<p>The commands of these "call" cards are, accordingly,
real plays for our little ones. The child calls, pronouncing
the name with a sort of sustained drawl; the child who
is called comes forward; then the same thing is done with
the other names, and each child obeys as he is called.
Then the incomplete calls begin: <em>blonde!</em> <em>blonde!</em> <em>beautiful!</em>
And no one moves! This makes a great impression
on the children. Imperative commands, like requests,
lend themselves to active dramatic action. Peter
has been called and has brought his chair; George has
brought the cube; Louis has taken out a frame; but
Charles sits there intent, expectant, while the child calls
out,&mdash;<em>But bring it to me, bring it to me quickly!</em> And
how expressive we found the vain request,&mdash;<em>Come, come!
please give me a kiss,&mdash;come, come!</em> At last the cry,&mdash;<em>Mary!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
come!</em> brings the resulting action and Mary runs
to give the kiss which has been so long invoked!</p>

<p>These little "plays" require a real study of the parts,
and the children rehearse their different rôles over and
over again.</p>

<p>The material for word analysis consists of small cards
for articles (tan), nouns (black) and adjectives (brown).
There is one box with three compartments, each section
marked with a card bearing the respective title: <em>article</em>,
<em>noun</em>, <em>adjective</em>. At the front of the box is a space for
other cards containing printed sentences to be analyzed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Descriptive Adjectives</span></h3>

<p>The child is to read the sentences, find the objects described
in them, and finally build the sentences with his
cards as follows: suppose the card reads:</p>



<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The child finds the three colored tablets used in the familiar
exercise of the "Children's House" for the education
of the sense of color. He places these tablets on
his table. Then he builds the phrases out of his word
cards:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">

<p>Beside the completed expression he places the green
color-tablet. Passing to the next phrase, he does not disturb
the words <em>the</em> and <em>color</em>. He removes only the word
<em>green</em> and substitutes for it the adjective <em>blue</em>, at the same
time removing the green tablet and substituting for it the
blue. Similarly, for the third phrase, he changes the adjective,
putting the red tablet at the end. Thus the <em>three
different objects</em> were distinguished <em>only</em> by the adjective:</p>

<p>All the phrases and sentences refer to objects used in
the previous educational material. Occasionally the
teacher will have to prepare something herself (e.g., hot,
cold, warm, or iced water; clear water; colored water).
For this exercise on <em>water</em>, the box contains six slips with
the six printed phrases. In the box-sections, the child
finds the corresponding word-cards which are exactly in
the number needed for the exercise (not corresponding,

<p>The teacher who is observing notices whether the child
has taken the right objects; if so, she proceeds to the
permutations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>At this point, the teacher should recall (in dealing with
Italian) the grammatical rules for the position of adjectives,
some of which (the fundamental ones) will certainly
be very useful to her in executing these first permutations:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. In general, the adjective follows the noun. If
placed before the noun, it is less conspicuous; if placed
after, it assumes more importance and has a different
force.</p>

<p>II. When the adjective is used to signify the exclusive
superlative of a quality, it is not only placed after the
noun, but is preceded by the article. (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Umberto il buono</i>,
"Humbert the Good.")</p>

<p>Example:&mdash;The child has composed the following
phrase with his cards: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il triangolo rettangolo</i> "the right-angled
triangle." The teacher can interchange the words
thus: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il rettangolo triangolo</i>, "the triangle right-angled."
Similarly also, for other phrases:&mdash;</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="word list">
<tr>
<td align="left">il prisma rettangolare azzurro</td>
<td align="left">the rectangular blue prism</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">il rettangolare azzurro prisma&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">the prism, rectangular, blue</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">i lapis neri</td>
<td align="left">the black pencils</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">i neri lapis</td>
<td align="left">the pencils black</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">il colore rosso</td>
<td align="left">the red color</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">il rosso colore</td>
<td align="left">the color red</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>Both the meaning and the child's habits show him the
normal position of the adjective. In some phrases, such
as,</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="word list">
<tr>
<td align="left">il rumore leggero&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">the faint sound</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">il sapore dolce</td>
<td align="left">the sweet taste</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>the placing of the adjective before the noun renders the
meaning vague, figurative, emotional, or generic, whereas
it would be clearly descriptive and precise were the adjective
in its normal position:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="word list">
<tr>
<td align="left">il dolce sapore</td>
<td align="left">the taste sweet</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">il leggero rumore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">the noise faint</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>(In English the normal position of the adjective is
before the noun. The permutation develops a strong
rhetorical flavor, of which the child will become conscious
later in his studies on poetic inversions.&mdash;Tr.)</p>

<p>After the teacher has made these changes, if they have
interested the child, she may say for example: "The
adjective comes after its noun" (for Italian); "The adjective
comes before its noun" (for English). In this
way she will have given a lesson in <em>theoretical</em> grammar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Inflection of Adjectives</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(Exclusively for the Italian language)</div>

<p>Another exercise to be done at the table deals with the
formation of the singular and plural of adjectives in the
two genders. This exercise brings the child in contact
with a great many adjectives of quality. Two series, one
of twenty masculine, the other of twenty feminine adjectives
(in the two numbers) and two other series, twenty
singulars and twenty plurals (in the two genders), form
four groups of cards, one-half of which (tied separately)
serves to direct the placing of the other half. Here are
the words in their groups:</p>

<p>Here, just as with the four noun forms (masculine,
feminine, singular and plural), class games may be found
useful. The plural forms may be dealt out to the class,
while one child reads aloud the singulars, one after the
other. The child, who, in a given case, has the proper
plural, reads his card in answer. Similarly, for masculine
and feminine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Logical and Grammatical Agreement of Nouns and
Adjectives</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(For Italian Exclusively)</div>

<p>Another table exercise consists in arranging two groups
of fifty cards, of which twenty-five are nouns (constituting
the directing group), while the other twenty-five are
adjectives. The nouns are put in a row and the child
looks among the adjectives (which have been thoroughly
shuffled) for those which are best suited to the different
nouns. As he finds them he places them by the nouns
with which they belong. Sometimes the nouns and adjectives
placed together cause a great deal of merriment by
the amusing contrasts that arise. The children try to
put as many adjectives as possible with the same noun
and develop in this way the most interesting combinations.

</table></div>

<p>For a class game with these lists, the nouns may be
placed on one table and the adjectives on another. Moving
as during the "silence" lesson, each child selects first
a noun, and then an adjective. When the selections have
all been made, the pairs are read one after the other amid
general enthusiasm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Descriptive Adjectives</span></h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">commands</span> (<em>Individual Lessons</em>)</div>

<p>The study of the adjective may furnish occasion for
giving the child a knowledge of physical properties (of
substances) so far unknown to him. For example, the
teacher may present a piece of transparent glass; a piece
of black glass (or any opaque screen); a sheet of white
paper with an oil stain. The child will see that through
the <em>transparent</em> glass objects may be seen distinctly; that
through the oil stain only the light is visible; that nothing
at all can be seen through the <em>opaque</em> screen. Or she may
take a small glass funnel and put into it a piece of filter
paper, then a sponge, then a piece of waterproof cloth.
The child observes that the water passes through the filter
paper, that the sponge absorbs water, and that the water
clings to the surface of the waterproof. Or take two glass
graduators and fill them with water to different heights.
In the case of the graduator filled to the very top, the surface
of the water is <em>convex;</em> in the other, it is <em>concave</em>.</p>

<p>The commands are printed on little slips of paper which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
are folded and all held together by an elastic band with a
series of brown cards containing the adjectives used in the
commands. Here is the material prepared:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Fill one graduator with water to the point of over-flowing,
and another not so full. Notice the form assumed by the surface
of the water in each case and apply the proper adjective:
<em>convex</em>, <em>concave</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take various objects such as filter paper, cloth, a sponge,
and see whether water can pass through them, applying the
adjectives: <em>permeable</em>, <em>impermeable</em>, <em>porous</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take a piece of clear glass, a sheet of black paper, a sheet
of oiled paper; look at the light through them, applying the
adjectives: <em>transparent</em>, <em>opaque</em>, <em>translucent</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Object lessens demonstrating comparative weights may
also be given by putting successively into a glass of water,
oil, alcohol colored with aniline, a piece of cork, a little
leaden ball (to be dropped). Then the command would
be:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Compare the weights of water and of colored alcohol;
water and oil; water and cork; and water and lead. Then tell
which is <em>heavier</em> and which is <em>lighter</em> than the other.</p></blockquote>

<p>As an answer the child should give a little written exercise
something like the following: <em>Water is heavier
than oil</em>, etc. The children actually perform these little
experiments, learning to handle graduators, funnels, filters,
etc., and to pour the last drops of water very carefully
so as to obtain the concave and convex surfaces.
They acquire a very delicate touch in pouring the colored
alcohol and oil on the water. Thus they take the first
step into the field of practical science.</p>

<p>To continue the study of adjectives of quality, there is a
series of commands relating to the comparative and superlative.
An example of the comparative crept into these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
experiments on weight. Here are additional commands
where the little slip and the brown cards are kept together.</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Take the blue stairs or any other objects and put with
each object the proper adjectives from the following list:
<em>thick</em>, <em>thin</em>, <em>thickest</em> (Ital. grossissimo), <em>thinnest</em> (Ital. finissimo).</p>

<p>&mdash;Take the eight tablets of the color you like best, arrange
them according to shades and apply the proper adjectives of
quality from the following: <em>light</em>, <em>lightest</em>, <em>dark</em>, <em>darkest</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take the series of circles in the plane insets, and pick out
the circles which correspond to these adjectives: <em>large</em>, <em>small</em>,
<em>intermediate</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take the cloths or other objects adapted to these adjectives:
<em>smooth</em>, <em>smoothest</em>, <em>rough</em>, <em>roughest</em>, <em>soft</em>, <em>softest</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take the cubes of the pink tower or any other objects
adapted to these adjectives: <em>large</em>, <em>largest</em>, <em>small</em>, <em>smallest</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Grade a number of objects according to weight so as to
fit these adjectives to them: <em>heavy</em>, <em>heaviest</em>, <em>light</em>, <em>lightest</em>.</p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adjectives of Quantity</span></h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">commands</span> (<i>Individual Lessons</i>)</div>

<p>Just as above, the slip is tied with the series of brown
cards by an elastic band. Thus a group is formed. In
our material the following three groups are available:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Take the counters and make little piles which correspond
in quantity to these adjectives: <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>, <em>three</em>, <em>four</em>, <em>five</em>, <em>six</em>,
etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;Take the beads and make little piles of them to fit these
adjectives: <em>few</em>, <em>none</em>, <em>many</em>, <em>some</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Decide first of all on some definite number of beads (two)
and then make other little piles to fit these adjectives: <em>double</em>,
<em>triple</em>, <em>quadruple</em>, <em>quintuple</em>, <em>sextuple</em>, <em>tenfold</em>, <em>half</em>, <em>equal</em>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ordinals</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(<i>Individual Commands</i>)</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Build the blue stair and on each step place the proper
adjective from the following: <em>first</em>, <em>second</em>, <em>third</em>, <em>fourth</em>, <em>fifth</em>,
<em>sixth</em>, <em>seventh</em>, <em>eighth</em>, <em>ninth</em>, <em>tenth</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Place the following adjectives on the different drawers
of the cabinet, beginning with the top drawer: <em>first</em>, <em>second</em>,
<em>third</em>, <em>fourth</em>, <em>fifth</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Differentiate between the drawers of the cabinet by the
following adjectives, beginning with the lowest: <em>first</em>, <em>second</em>,
<em>third</em>, <em>fourth</em>, <em>fifth</em>.</p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Demonstrative Adjectives</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(<i>Class Lessons</i>)</div>

<p>As occasion may offer, the teacher may assemble a group
of children and give them a few simple explanations on
the meaning of certain words: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">questo</i>, "this" (near us);
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cotesto</i>, "that" (near you); <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quello</i>, "that" (over there
away from both of us). (Note: English lacks the demonstrative
of the second person.)</p>

<p>Then she can distribute these commands which require
collective actions of the class:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Gather in <em>that</em> (codesto) corner of the room near you;
then all of you come over to <em>this</em> (questo) corner near me;
then all of you run over to that (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quello</i>) corner over there.</p>

<p>&mdash;Choose one of your school-mates and tell him to put a
box on <em>this</em> (questo) table; a small plate on <em>that</em> (quello)
table over there.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tell one of your companions, pointing at the place, to put
a green bead in <em>this</em> (questo) vase; a blue one in <em>that</em> (codesto)
vase; a white one in <em>that</em> (quello) vase over there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrange the children in groups in three different places
in the room, and then give this command:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Let <em>that</em> (quello) group over there take the place of <em>this</em>
(questo) group. Let <em>that</em> (codesto) group break up, the children
going back to their tables.</p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Possessive Adjectives</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(<i>Class Lessons</i>)</div>

<p>In like manner the teacher explains the meaning of the
words <em>my</em>, <em>your</em>, <em>his</em>, <em>her</em>, etc. She may do this with a
simple gesture. Here are the commands:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Point out various objects saying: This is <em>my</em> slate; that
is <em>your</em> slate; that (over there) is <em>her</em> slate.</p>

<p>&mdash;Point at the different seats, saying: That (over there)
is <em>his</em> place, that is <em>your</em> place, and this is <em>my</em> place.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pass around the little baskets, saying: This is <em>my</em> basket.
Whose is that other basket? Is it <em>your</em> basket? And this one?
Ah, this one is <em>his</em> basket.</p>

<p>&mdash;Let us take a turn around the room and then return to <em>our</em>
seats. <em>You</em> go to <em>your</em> seat and <em>they</em> will go to <em>their</em> seats.
Then we will divide up our things. Let us put <em>our</em> things here
and <em>their</em> things there. We will go to <em>your</em> seats and you go
to <em>their</em> seats. Meanwhile they will get up and then come over
here to take <em>our</em> places.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Signora Montessori does not differentiate between the
possessive <em>adjective</em> and the possessive <em>pronoun;</em> perhaps
because there is in Italian no characteristic pronominal
form. Strictly speaking the Italian predicate form <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mio</i>
(e.g., <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questo libra è mio</i>) is adjectival, while the form <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">il
mio</i> (i.e., with the definite article) is pronominal (e.g.,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questo è il mio</i>). English has, however, the pronominal
possessives: <em>mine</em>, <em>yours</em> (thine), <em>his</em>, <em>hers</em>, <em>ours</em>, <em>yours</em>,
<em>theirs</em>, used also as predicate adjectives. The above exercise
should therefore he repeated later under the subject
of pronouns in a slightly different form.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr.</span>]</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>VERBS</div>


<p>When I gave the first grammar lessons to defective children
I put special emphasis on nouns and verbs. The
noun (= object), and the verb (= action) were distinguished
with the greatest clearness, much as we distinguish
matter from energy, chemistry from physics. <em>Condition</em>
and <em>motion</em>, as potential and kinetic energy, are
both expressed by verbs. Whereas formerly the child
took the objects in his hands and studied their name and
attributes, here he must <em>perform</em> actions. In the execution
of actions he must necessarily receive some help, for
he is not always capable of interpreting the word with
the precise action which corresponds to it. On the contrary,
the study of the verb is necessary to initiate him
into a series of "object lessons" upon the different actions
he must perform. The teacher therefore must give individual
lessons teaching the child to interpret the verb.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Analyses</span></h3>

<p>In the usual manner we present a box which has four
compartments, for the article, the noun, the adjective, and
the verb. The sections are designated by the usual title
cards: tan, black, brown, and red. In the compartment
at the back of the box there are six slips for each exercise,
and for every written word there is a card, except
for such words as are repeated in successive sentences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
For example: if the following sentences are written on
the cards:</p>

<div class='list1'>
Close the door!<br />
Lock the door!<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>on the corresponding cards will be found the words:</div>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="words">
<tr>
<td align="left">Lock</td>
<td align="left" class='topr'>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left" rowspan='2'>&nbsp;the door.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Close</td>
<td align="left" class='crightb'>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table></div>


<p>And so the child after he has composed his first sentence
needs to change only one card (<em>lock</em> for <em>close</em>) for the
second sentence. This brings out the force of the verb,
showing that one sentence may be changed into another
by indicating an entirely different action. The child performs
the action and then on his table he builds the sentences
with the cards. In the series we have prepared,
the verbs are either synonyms or antonyms. Here is the
material:</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The teacher should have in mind the grammatical rules
for the position of the verb in the sentence, to give the
child a clear idea of its normal location before the direct
object: "first the verb, then the object upon which it
acts."</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class='indent'>
Smooth the white paper.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The verb should, for the first permutation, be transferred
to the end:</div>

<div class='indent'>
the white paper smooth.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Or, if you wish,</div>

<div class='indent'>
Arrange the brown cards.<br />
the brown cards arrange.<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>When the verb is taken away entirely the action vanishes:</div>

<div class='indent'>
Lift   the red counter.<br />
Drop <br />
the red counter.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Making all possible permutations, the child sees that only
one order of words is capable of bringing a meaning out
of the confusion:</div>

<div class='indent'>
Roll the white handkerchief.<br />
the white handkerchief roll.<br />
white the handkerchief roll.<br />
white roll handkerchief the.<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lessons and Commands on the Verb</span></h3>

<p>The children take considerable delight in our verb lessons
which develop through interpretations of actions.
We use packs of red cards, tied with an elastic, each pack
containing ten cards. The child executes the actions indicated
on each card, one after the other. He may afterward
copy the cards&mdash;an exercise specially attractive to
very young children.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;walk, sing, jump, dance, bow, sit, sleep, wake, pray, sigh.</p>

<p>&mdash;write, erase, weep, laugh, hide, draw, read, speak, listen,
run.</p>

<p>&mdash;arrange, clean, dust, sweep, button, lace, tie, hook, greet,
brush.</p>

<p>&mdash;comb, wash, wipe, embrace, kiss, smile, yawn, scowl, stare,
breathe.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are fairly common words, representing actions
more or less familiar to the pupils. But this exercise is
only an introduction to the real verb-lessons. For these
the teacher selects, as subject for a lesson, a series of
synonymous verbs. Their shades of meaning are taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to the children by translating them into action, the teacher
executing the action herself. She then distributes around
the class commands making use of the verbs in question.
There may be several copies of a given command if the
pupils are very numerous. The child reads by himself
the card he has received, executing the action from memory
of what he has seen the teacher do. We have tested
experimentally the Italian material (<abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the verbs in
parentheses), as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lessons with Experiments</span></h3>

<p>The function of the verb can be still more interestingly
emphasized by suggesting actions designed to increase the
child's knowledge in the direction of elementary science.
Here the teacher, instead of executing simple movements,
performs experiments, which on the same day or on succeeding
days the child can imitate guided by the directions
in the commands.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>stir, mix, beat, flavor (mescolare, emulsionare, stemperare).</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Take a bowl half full of water and drop into it a half
cup of flour; <em>stir</em> with a spoon until the mixture is thick.</p>

<p>&mdash;Place a table-spoonful of vinegar and a table-spoonful of
olive-oil in a clean bowl; <em>beat</em> them together until an emulsion
is formed.</p>

<p>&mdash;Place a tea-spoonful of chocolate and a tea-spoonful of
sugar in a cup and <em>mix</em> them thoroughly. What color was the
chocolate? What color was the sugar? What color is the
mixture?</p>

<p>&mdash;Take a little milk in a cup and taste of it; add a drop
of vanilla extract. Then taste of the milk again. Do you
taste the vanilla? In the same way <em>flavor</em> a glass of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with the vanilla. <em>Flavor</em> another glass of water with vinegar.</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>dissolve, saturate, be in suspension (sciogliere, fare la sospensiona,
saturare).</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Place a spoonful of sugar in a glass of warm water and
<em>dissolve</em> the sugar by stirring with a spoon. Is the water still
clear?</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>Saturate</em> the water with sugar by continuing to add sugar
and stirring till you can see the sugar at the bottom of the
glass. Allow the water to rest a moment. Is the water still
clear?</p>

<p>&mdash;Mix a spoonful of starch in the water. The water becomes
white, since the starch does not <em>dissolve</em> but remains <em>in
suspension</em> in the water.</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>strain, filter (decantare, filtrare).</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Take the glass containing the water saturated with sugar
and the one with the starch in suspension, and allow the starch
and sugar to settle for some time, until the water is clear.
Taste the water in each glass, and then <em>strain</em> each glass of
water separately.</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>Filter</em> the water saturated with sugar and the water with
the suspended starch. Then taste of each.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the time all these commands have been executed, the
child will have developed a keen desire to go on, becoming
so interested in the meaning of verbs as not to require further
commands to stimulate his study of these words.
The most frequent question now is "How many verbs are
there in the language?" "Are there more in other languages?"
etc. To satisfy this new curiosity of the children
we have dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
word-charts. But meantime they have been building
their own dictionaries. One by one they begin to own
copy books (rubrics) with illuminated letters of the alphabet.
Under the proper letter the child copies his
words as fast as he learns them. We are still experimenting
on the question of the exact amount of information
that may successfully be offered to elementary school children
of various ages and stages of development, with the
word material required for the notions of natural history,
physics and chemistry they may be expected to acquire.
We can say, at this moment, simply that each experiment
involves the use of a certain number of new words (nouns,
adjectives and verbs), which are copied into the word-books
(rubrics) as fast as they occur.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PREPOSITIONS</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Analyses</span></h3>

<p>Here also the first exercise is to compose sentences
analyzed with the colored cards. This grammar box has
five compartments, each with a small title card of the
color corresponding to the different parts of speech, red
for the verb, black for the noun, brown for the adjective,
tan for the article and <em>violet</em> for the <em>preposition</em>. In the
compartment at the rear of the box are six cards with
printed sentences. The colored cards do not correspond
exactly to the number of words used in the sentences because
the words of one sentence which are repeated in
the next are not duplicated in the cards. In this case it
is the change in preposition only which alters the meaning
of the sentence. Here are the series of sentences,
some of which the teacher may have used already in previous
lessons (commands).</p>


<h3>SERIES A</h3>

by adjectives: <em>cloth of cotton</em> = <em>cotton cloth;</em> or by the
possessive inflection with <em>-s:</em> <em>the drawing of George = George's
drawing</em>. In Italian they are expressed by the prepositions
<em>di</em>, <em>per</em>, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">da</i>, etc.: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">stoffa di cotone</i> "cotton cloth," <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">piattino di

<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The child has built the first sentences on each of the
slips with his cards, and he has reproduced the others by
changing simply the preposition cards. In this way he
has seen how the position of objects relative to each other
is determined wholly and only by the use of the preposition.
The preposition, therefore, determines the <em>relation
of words</em>, the relation of a <em>noun</em> to some other word,
here to another <em>noun</em> or to a <em>verb</em>. In the phrase,</p>

<div class='indent'>Set one chair opposite another chair,</div>

<div class='unindent'>if we take away the preposition, leaving,</div>

<div class='indent'>Set one chair another chair,</div>

<div class='unindent'>the relation that formerly existed between the words <em>chair</em>
and <em>another chair</em> is lost. The teacher must not forget
the rules for the position of the preposition. The preposition
must always precede its object and no other word can
come between it and the word or words it controls.</div>

<p>Here are some examples of sentences in the above exercises
from which the preposition has been taken away by
the teacher:</p>

<div class='indent'>Go from your seat the cabinet.<br />

Place a chair the door.<br />

Lay the counter the box.<br />

Place the prism the cylinder.<br />

The china saucer is made china.</div>

<p>To give the child an idea of the normal position of
prepositions a series of permutations may be made leaving
the preposition and its object in their normal positions.
In this case some meaning is still left to the sentence:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class='indent'>Stretch a string from the door to the window.<br />

From the door to the window stretch a string.<br />

Stretch from the door a string to the window.<br />

From the door to the window a string stretch.<br />

From the door stretch to the window a string.</div>

<p>But the child will recognize that the right sentence is
the simplest and the clearest:</p>

<div class='indent'>Stretch a string from the door to the window.</div>

<p>On the other hand if we separate the preposition from
its object or invert their normal position, the meaning is
entirely lost:</p>

<div class='indent'>Stretch a string the door from the window to.<br />

Stretch a string from the door window to the.<br />

String from the stretch door to the a window.</div>


<p>And likewise with these other sentences:</p>

<div class='indent'>Run from the wash-stand to the table.<br />

Run wash-stand table (<em>definition of motion lacking</em>).<br />

Run wash-stand from the table to the.<br />

From the run wash-stand to the table.<br />

Wash-stand from the to the run table.</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lessons and Commands on Prepositions</span></h3>

<p>The teacher may also take groups of children and give
them short lessons on the preposition to explain the meaning,
selecting if possible two or three synonyms or antonyms
each time. The lessons should always he practical
and full of action. The child should come to understand
in this case the relationship established by this or that
preposition between the object (noun) and the action
(verb) to be performed. As soon as this has been made
clear by the teacher the commands are distributed to the
children who put them into execution. Here is the material
that we use:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The sentences to be analyzed are reproduced as usual
by building the first sentence on each slip; and then, by
changing the adverb, the child gets the second or third
sentence. One of the first permutations is to remove the
adverb from those sentences where it performs the function
of an <em>adjective to the verb</em>, thereby causing one action
to be changed into another. For example take the two
sentences:</p>

<div class='list1'>
Walk slowly to the window.<br />
Walk rapidly to the window.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Taking away the adverb we have:</div>

<div class='list1'>
Walk to the window.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The child can perform the action which, now, is a simple
one. The adverb, however, changes, <em>modifies</em>, the action.
If the teacher in play puts the two adverbs together
in the same sentence the child has the problem of
interpreting two contrary movements. That is, he is to
go to the window <em>slowly</em> and <em>rapidly</em> at the same time.
Taking away the adverb cards the sentence left is <em>Go to
the window</em>. This action the child can perform. But
how shall he perform it, in what way? With the help
of adverbs! Similarly in the following sentences:</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class='list1'>
Bend your head <em>a little</em>.<br />
Bend your head <em>much</em>.<br />
</div>

<p>Written without the adverb they indicate one action.
What slight changes in the position of the head can be
brought about by these adverbs! It is the <em>adverb</em> which
really shows fine differentiations in movement!</p>

<p>In other sentences also where the adverb is, so to
speak, an <em>adjective</em> to an <em>adjective</em> and therefore really
affects the object (noun), similar permutations may be
made.</p>

<div class='list2'>
Make a broad mark on the blackboard.<br />
Make a <em>very</em> broad mark on the blackboard.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Here by the use of an adverb two different <em>objects</em> (nouns)
are distinguished which, though they have the same quality
(breadth) differ in degree (broad, very broad). Take,
for instance, two objects belonging to the same series:</div>

<div class='list2'>
Place on your table the prism which is most thick.<br />
Place on your table the prism which is least thick.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If the adverbs are taken away the factor determining the
degree of quality (thickness) disappears and we have sentences
which are far less precise in their meaning:</div>

<div class='list2'>
Place on your table the prism which is thick.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>As the teacher proceeds to make permutations in the different
sentences she should remember (for Italian) that
the normal position of the adverb is after the verb (in
the compound tenses it comes between the auxiliary and
the participle).</div>

<p>(Note: In English the position of the adverb is much
freer than in Italian; it often stands at the end of the
sentence and even between subject and verb,&mdash;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
quite foreign to normal Italian usage. We retain the
text entire.)</p>

<p>In the sentences analyzed by the child it is sufficient
to recall that the adverb modifies the verb and follows the
verb it modifies. Take the sentence:</p>

<div class='list2'>
Bend your head a little as you write.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If the adverb is placed after the second verb the meaning
changes:</div>

<div class='list2'>
Bend your head as you write a little.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The same is true in the following:</div>

<div class='list2'>
Walk along the hall swinging your arms somewhat.<br />
Walk somewhat along the hall swinging your arms.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>General shifting of position would give results as follows:</div>

<div class='list2'>
Bend a little your head as you write.<br />
A little bend your head as you write, etc., etc.<br />
Somewhat walk along the hall swinging your arms.<br />
Walk along somewhat the hall swinging your arms, etc., etc.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The child is quick to recognize by ear the accurate, the
normal position of the adverb.</div>

<p>On the other hand, adverbs of quantity and comparison
precede the adjective:</p>

<div class='list2'>
Make a very broad mark on the blackboard.<br />
Place on your table the prism that is least thick.<br />
</div>

<p>Permutation gives the following results:</p>

<div class='list2'>
Make a broad very mark on the blackboard.<br />
Place on your table the prism which thick least is, etc., etc.<br />
</div>

<p>Adverbs of time and place often ring like trumpet calls
to attention at the beginning of the sentence:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class='list2'>
Drink the water in the glass now.<br />
Now drink the water in the glass.<br />
</div>

<p>(Note: In English the adverb of time, placed at the
end of the sentence, gains quite as much emphasis. So for
adverbs of place.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Burst of Activity:</span></h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Future of the Written Language In
Popular Education</span></div>

<p>In our own private experiments when we reached the
adverb there occurred among the children a veritable explosion
into a new kind of activity. They insisted on
making up commands themselves. They invented them
and then read them aloud to their companions or had
their companions interpret the slips which they had written.
All were most enthusiastic in performing these
commands and they were rigorously scrupulous in acting
them out down to the minutest detail. The executions
came to be a literal, intensely real dramatisation: if a
word was inexact or incorrect, the interpretation of the
command threw the error into noisy relief, and the child
who has written it saw before him an action quite different
from what he had in mind. Then he realized that
he had expressed his thought wrongly or inadequately and
immediately set to work to correct his mistake. The revelation
seemed to redouble his energy. He would hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
among his numerous words for the one necessary to translate
his idea into a living scene before his eyes. Suppose
a child had written the following sentence involving
the use of the adverb <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sempre</i> "always":</p>

<div class='indent'>
Walk about the room (sempre) <em>always</em> on tip-toe.<br />
</div>

<p>meaning that the child should <em>all the while</em> go on tip-toe;
if the child began to walk on tip-toe and continued
to do so for a long time, trying to express <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sempre</i> (always&mdash;forever)
he would find himself facing a serious
problem. Hence the spontaneous query: "What must I
do to express myself correctly?"</p>

<p>A little girl once wrote "Walk around the tables,"
meaning that the children should form a line and walk
in and out around each table. Instead she saw her companions
form a line and walk round the entire group of
tables. Red in the face and out of breath she kept calling:
"Stop, stop. That isn't the way," just as if this
difference between the thought she actually had in mind
and the way it was being executed were hurting her intolerably.</p>

<p>This is only a passing suggestion of something which,
I think, will merit much further development later on,
after more thorough experiment. It will suffice, however,
to bring to the teacher a notion of a most fertile
field for the development of the written language in its
most rigorous purity. It is evident that the experiment
shows the possibility not only of having spontaneous compositions
without grammatical errors (just as the mechanical
writing was spontaneous and without errors), but of
developing a love for clearness and purity of speech which
will be a potent factor in improving the literary appreciation
of the masses, and popular culture generally.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children are seized with this passion for accurate
expression of their thoughts in writing, when,
spontaneously, clearness becomes the goal of their efforts,
they follow the hunt for words with the keenest enthusiasm.
They feel that there are never too many words to
build with exactness the delicate edifice of thought.
Problems of language come to them as a revelation.
"How many words are there?" they ask. "How many
nouns, how many verbs, how many adjectives? Is there
any way for us to learn them all?" They are no longer
content with their little copy-books of words. They ask
for a wealth of word material which they now enjoy with
all the delight of attractive and orderly interpretation.
They never get tired of it.</p>

<p>These developments in our work suggested to us the
idea of giving the children a large vocabulary comprising
a sufficient number of nouns, verbs, and adjectives and
containing <em>all</em> the words of the other parts of speech.
The difference in bulk between the real content of language
(substance and modification, that is, nouns with
their adjectives, and verbs with their adverbs) and the
other words which serve to establish relations and consolidate
this content, is something very impressive to children
of eight. It is for them that we tried to prepare
our word charts and the dictionaries of synonyms for
nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Here, meanwhile, are some
of the commands which the children wrote themselves&mdash;things
which they improvised all of a sudden, by an explosion
of energy, as it were, developed as the result of
inner maturity. Compare the aridity and uniformity of
the commands we invented ourselves with the variety and
richness of ideas appearing in the children's commands!
We very evidently show the weariness the preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the material caused us. They, on the contrary, reveal
an ardent, vivacious spirit, a life full of exuberance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The function of the pronoun as a substitute for a noun
has been made clear in the analysis of the above sentences.
After the children themselves have composed the first sentence
with the colored cards they form the second sentence
by taking away the noun card and substituting the
corresponding pronoun. In the work done by the teacher
to give the child an idea of the normal position of the
pronoun, let her remember that in Italian personal pronouns
precede the verb except in interrogation (where
the subject may follow) and in cases where the subject
is specially emphasized and where the pronouns appear
as a suffix (infinitive, participle and imperative).</p>

<div class='indent'>
He soothed her with a kiss.<br />
He her soothed with a kiss, etc., etc.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>[It will become apparent that in English the personal
pronoun takes the position of the noun, whereas for Italian
the pronoun shifts to a position in front of the verb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Considerable variety develops in English when the noun
is replaced by a relative pronoun. However, the different
problems arising in connection with pronouns generally
are so complex that we return to this subject, especially
to the question of subject and object forms, in dealing
with sentence-analysis later.]</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lessons and Commands on the Pronoun</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<div class='indent'>
Subjective Personal Pronouns: I, you, he, she, we, you, they (io, tu, egli, essa, noi, voi, loro, etc.).<br />
</div>

<p>Explain these pronouns as briefly and practically as
possible from the point of view of speaker and listener,
etc., one child commanding the others while they <em>execute</em>
the command along with him. Example: The teacher,
named for instance Anna Fedeli, explains in this way:
"I don't say <em>Anna Fedeli;</em> I say <em>I</em>." "To Carlino here
I don't say Carlino; I say, <em>you</em>." "Of Gigino, over there,
I don't say Gigino; I say <em>he</em>," etc., etc.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Command:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>The command is given by a child; but he himself executes the
first personal form along with the other children:</p></blockquote>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;<em>I</em> walk around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> walk around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>She</em> walks around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>He</em> walks around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>We</em> walk around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> walk around the table<br />
&mdash;<em>They</em> walk around the table<br />
<br />
&mdash;<em>I</em> raise my arms<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> raise your arms<br />
&mdash;<em>She</em> raises her arms<br />
&mdash;<em>He</em> raises his arms<br />
&mdash;<em>We</em> raise our arms<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> raise your arms<br />
&mdash;<em>They</em> raise their arms<br />
<br />
&mdash;<em>I</em> lift the chair<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> lift the chair<br />
&mdash;<em>He</em> lifts the chair, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
&mdash;<em>I</em> take the ink-stand<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> take the ink-stand<br />
&mdash;<em>He</em> takes the ink-stand, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
&mdash;<em>I</em> wave my handkerchief<br />
&mdash;<em>You</em> wave your handkerchief, etc., etc.<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>From these exercises the notion gradually develops
that:</p>

<div class='indent'>
the <em>first person</em> is the one who <em>speaks;</em><br />
the <em>second person</em> is the one who <em>listens;</em><br />
the <em>third person</em> is the one spoken of.<br />
</div>

<p>Other commands may be dramatized by small groups as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;The first person must put a question the second must answer, and the third from a distance must try to hear both of them.</p>

<p>&mdash;Let the first one write, the second one watch, and the third one say "That is not right."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following commands may be read aloud by the
child:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;<em>I</em> ask you a question very softly. <em>You</em> answer <em>me;</em> and <em>he</em>, over there, must try to hear both of us.</p>

<p>&mdash;<em>I</em> shall write; <em>you</em> must act as if you were trying to read what I am writing; and then <em>he</em>, over there, will call out: "That is not right."</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>Direct Objective Personal Pronouns: me, you, him, her, us,
you, them (mi, ti, si, lo, la, ci, vi, si, li, le).</p>

<p>Reflexives and reciprocals: myself, yourself, etc., each other.</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Command:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>(Here too one child commands executing the first personal
forms, while the others act out the second and third):</p>

<p>&mdash;I touch the oil-cloth on the table; I touch <em>myself;</em> I touch
<em>you;</em> you touch <em>yourself;</em> I touch <em>him;</em> you touch <em>her;</em> let us
touch <em>each other;</em> you touch <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Charles, take the whisk-broom and brush the table; Charles,
brush <em>me;</em> Charles, brush <em>him;</em> Charles, brush <em>her;</em> Charles,
brush <em>yourself</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mary and I bow to the teacher; now we bow to <em>you;</em> now
we bow to <em>him;</em> now we bow to <em>her;</em> now we bow to <em>each other</em>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;I lead George by the hand to the window; I lead <em>you</em> by the
hand to the window; I lead <em>him</em> by the hand to the window; he
leads <em>us</em> by the hand to the window; we lead <em>her</em> by the hand to
the window.</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>Indirect object personal pronouns: me, te, se, mi, ti, si, le,
gli, lui, lei, noi, voi, ci, vi, loro (the disjunctive pronouns, used
after prepositions, etc., do not differ in English from the simple
direct object forms).</p>

<p>(The commands are still executed as above):</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;I am going to distribute these pencils: one to <em>you</em>, one to <em>him</em>, one to <em>her;</em> one to <em>myself</em>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Louis, give <em>me</em> a command; give <em>him</em> a command; give <em>her</em> a command; give <em>yourself</em> a command.</p>

<p>&mdash;Attention! Charles, give <em>her</em> a blue bead! Mary, give <em>him</em> a red bead!</p>

<p>&mdash;Alfred, give a white bead to <em>me;</em> give <em>me</em> also a yellow bead!</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>Demonstratives for persons (questi, costui, colui; the second
person, "that one near you," is lacking in English, which also
fails to distinguish between persons and things and between
genders).</p></blockquote>

<p>When the distinctions in space represented by these pronouns
have been taught as above the children read and
execute as follows:</p>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>Distribute the pronouns to different children in the class;
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">questi</i>, "this one (near me)," <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costei</i> (feminine); <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costui</i>, "that
one (near you)," <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costei</i> (fem.); <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colui</i>, "that one (over there),"
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colei</i> (fem.); when the children are in their proper places, give
to each child a different command.</p>

<p>&mdash;Call to you a boy and a girl, and then command: <em>that one</em>
(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costui</i>) go and get a case; <em>that one</em> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costei</i>) go and get a
counter; <em>those</em> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costoro</i>) keep far away and preserve complete
silence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;Point to two children, one standing near you and one far
away; then command: <em>that one</em> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colui</i>) go and fetch an armchair
for <em>that one</em> (fem. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costei</i>) and a chair for <em>this one</em>
(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">questo</i>); then have him return to his place. Then have all the
children execute the commands which <em>those</em> (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">costoro</i>) will now
give.</p></blockquote>

<p>In case the class is made up entirely of girls or
entirely of boys, the children find considerable amusement
in trying to imitate the manners of whichever opposite
sex is missing.</p>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<blockquote><p>Demonstratives of things (questo, cotesto, quello, ciò, ne);
here also English has no pronoun of the second person (<em>that
near you</em>), nor does it possess the general indefinite <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ciò</i> (referring
to a general idea: <em>that</em> (ciò) <i>is true</i>).</p>

<p>When the meaning of these words, in terms of space location,
has been taught, the children execute as follows:</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;You children divide into three groups; then go and occupy
three different places; change places as follows: you leave <i>that</i>
(<i>cotesto</i>) and occupy <i>that</i> over there; the others leave <i>that</i>
(<i>quello</i>) and occupy this (<i>questo</i>).</p></blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>Subject:</div>

<div class='indent'>
Possessives: mine, yours (thine), his, hers, its, ours, yours, theirs.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Commands:&mdash;</div>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;Point out various objects, saying: This is my slate; that one is <i>yours</i>, that is <i>hers</i>, and this one is <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Point at the different seats, saying: Here are our places, that is <i>mine</i> and this is <i>yours</i>. Those over there are <i>theirs</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pass around little baskets, saying: This is my basket. Whose is that? Is that <i>yours?</i> Is this <i>hers?</i> Are these <i>ours?</i>
Is this one <i>his?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We dealt with the relatives only incidentally in the
analyses (Group C above); we do not treat them here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
postponing the study of them in detail to the chapter on
sentence-analysis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paradyms</span></h3>

<p>In teaching the declension of the pronouns we use the
method employed by us in teaching all inflections: bundles
of cards, of which one group is tied separately and serves
as a guide. The child arranges the cards on the table,
working first on the guiding group and putting the pronouns
in order of persons: first, second, third.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Agreement of Pronoun and Verb</span></h3>

<p>The cards given to the child for this work are green for
the personal pronoun subjects, and red for the verb forms
of the three simple tenses, present, past, and future.
There are, for Italian, three groups corresponding to the
three conjugations: <i>amare</i>, <i>temere</i>, <i>sentire</i>. The child's
work is to place the pronouns in the proper order of person
(first, second, third, singular and plural) and to put after
each pronoun the corresponding verb form. Each child

<p>The child can shuffle his cards in various ways, mixing
the verb forms of the three different Italian verbs, or the
four tense forms of the English verb; passing then to a
reconstruction of the different tenses according to the pronouns,
the order of which has by this time become familiar
to him.</p>

<p>The next step is to conjugate properly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conjugations of Verbs</span></h3>

<div class='center'>MATERIAL</div>

<p>In our material we offer (for Italian) the conjugation
of the two auxiliary verbs (<i>essere</i> "to be," <i>avere</i> "to
have") and the model verbs of the first, second and third
conjugations. The colors used for the five verbs are all
different, yellow for <i>essere</i> "to be," black for <i>avere</i> "to
have," pink for <i>amare</i> "to love," green for <i>temere</i> "to
fear," light blue for <i>sentire</i> "to hear." Each card has
both pronoun and verb form. This is not only to simplify
and expedite the exercise but also to make sure of auto-exercise,
since the pronoun guides the order of the forms
in each tense. These verb forms of a given verb preceded
by the pronouns are, accordingly, made into a little
package. Here, however, the groups are not so simple
as in other cases. For the verb, the cards are kept in a
sort of red envelope tied with a ribbon. The infinitive
of the verb is written on the outside of the envelope,
which, though very simple, is most attractive. When the
whole verb is wrapped in its package and tied with the
ribbon, it forms a small red prism of the following dimensions:
cmm. 35 X 4 X 5.5. On untying the ribbon and
opening the envelope the child finds inside ten little "volumes"
with red covers. These volumes represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>moods</i> of the verb and they have the following titles inscribed
on the first page:</p>

<div class='list1'>
Indicative Mood<br />
Conditional Mood (for Italian)<br />
Subjunctive Mood<br />
Imperative Mood<br />
Verbals<br />
</div>

<p>To facilitate replacing these materials in an orderly way
and to be sure that this order is recognized, the child finds
in the corner of each envelope a Roman numeral (I, II,
III, IV, V); and besides that, an Arabic numeral indicating
the number of tenses in the given mood. On opening
the little volume and taking off the cover we find
many other tiny volumes with red covers. These are the
tenses. In the middle of each cover is written the name
and, to one side, the number indicating the relative position
of the tenses in the following manner: the <i>simple</i> tense
is marked with the letter <i>S</i> and the <i>compound</i> tense with
the letter <i>C</i>. The titles, then, of the eight booklets contained
in the little volume for a given mood are:</p>

<div class='list1'>
Present Tense 1s<br />
Past Tense 2s<br />
Future Tense 3s<br />
Perfect Tense 1c<br />
Pluperfect Tense 2c<br />
Future Perfect Tense 3c<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>(For Italian the tenses are: Present, 1s, Imperfect 2s,
Remote Past 3s, Future 4s, Perfect 1c, Pluperfect 2c,
Past Anterior 3c, Future Perfect 4c.)</div>

<p>Finally, on opening each of these little booklets (which,
by the way, are 3.5 X 4 cmm. and only a bare millimeter
thick) we have the cards with the verb forms preceded by
the corresponding pronoun.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>This rather resembles the famous egg in which a number
of smaller and smaller eggs were enclosed. For this beautiful
package forming as a whole the entire conjugation of
the verb contains the booklets of the different moods, which
in their turn contain the smaller booklets of the tenses.
The orderly enumeration of the moods and tenses, together
with the pronouns which serve to show the order of the
verb forms, allows the child to conjugate the entire verb
by himself and to study the classification of the different
forms that make it up. In fact the children need no help
in this exercise. Once they have this attractive, complicated,
and mysterious little red package, they evolve on
their little tables in an orderly way the entire conjugation
of the verb. Having learned the verb forms little by little
they shuffle the cards of the different tenses in various
ways and then try to put them in their regular order.
At length they are able to shuffle all the cards in the entire
verb as the children in the "Children's House" did
with the sixty-four colors; and to reconstruct correctly the
whole conjugation by tense and by mood. They themselves
finally ask to write the verb and they prepare of their
own accord new booklets writing out the new verbs as
they meet them.</p>

<p>For this purpose we have included in our materials
many booklets likewise covered in red and filled with <i>blank</i>
cards of a variety of colors. The children themselves fill
out these cards in conjugating their new verbs.</p>

<p>The exercises both of working out the conjugation of
the verb and of writing out new verbs may be performed
at home.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The removal of the conjunction destroys the relationship
between the words, and this brings out its function in the
sentence:</p>

Put away the pen the ink-stand.<br />
<br />
Put away the pen or the ink-stand.<br />
Put away the pen the ink-stand.<br />

You could write with your left hand if you touched the letters with that hand.<br />
You could write with your left hand you touched the letters with that hand.<br />
</div>

<p>The conjunction must be placed between the words it
connects: otherwise the meaning is changed or destroyed:</p>

<div class='indent'>
Put away the pen and the ink-stand.<br />
Put and away the pen the ink-stand.<br />
<br />
The "Children's House" is attractive because it is pretty.<br />

<h2>XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INTERJECTIONS</div>


<p>Since this is the last part of speech to be studied the
children are now able to recognize <i>all</i> the different parts
of speech and it is no longer necessary to make sentences
containing only parts of speech which the children know.
Therefore in our Italian lessons we choose henceforth
sentences from the classic authors (mostly from Manzoni).
Since the interjection is really a thought expressed in an
abbreviated form it lends itself readily to dramatic interpretation.
With the same sentence the children accordingly
can now perform the two-fold exercise of general analysis
and "interpretative reading." They now recite
sentences which they have picked out and studied instead
of the commands. At this time also they are given a chart
containing the complete classification of interjections.
The children read them, interpreting each as they go along
by voice and gesture. This is the first table of classification
to be presented. Later on all the parts of speech will
be given on charts with their definitions and classification.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Analyses</span></h3>

<p>Material: The grammar box is complete. It now has
nine separate compartments for the colored cards, article
(tan), noun (black), adjective (brown), verb (red), preposition
(violet), adverb (pink), pronoun (green), conjunction
(yellow), and <i>interjection</i> (<i>blue</i>). In the compartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for the sentence slips are groups of cards which
correspond exactly to the number of the words contained
in the sentences.</p>


<div class='subsection'>GROUP A<br />

(Per amor del cielo! oibò! addio! ehm! misericordia! ah!)</div>

<p><i>Please!</i> Don't make so much noise!</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>Shame on you!</i> exclaimed Henry, much shocked at those words.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Good-by!</i> We shall see you to-morrow.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Look out!</i> If you drop that vase, you will break it.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Mercy on us!</i> What is the matter with the poor man?</div>

(Ohè! ih! toh! poveretto! ahi! ohi! eh! animo! uh! ton!)</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Farewell!</i> The ship gradually drew away from the shore! The
houses faded from view one by one. The hills formed a
low line on the horizon. <i>Farewell!</i> It would be months,
years perhaps, before George would see the old familiar
town again. <i>Farewell!</i></div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Help! Help!</i> came a voice through the fog! A man was
drowning.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Hush!</i> Do you hear that bird singing in the distance?</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Alas!</i> It was too late! When the doctor came, the poor man
was dead!</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang2'><i>Hurrah! Hurrah!</i> The soldiers were now almost at the top of
the hill. <i>Hurrah! hurrah!</i> The red-white-and-blue was
waving at last where the enemy had held out so long!</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Bang!</i> In the still night the sound of a gun roused the sleeping
inhabitants.</div>

<p>(In general the use of interjections, especially of capricious
character, is much more characteristic of the best
Italian writing and speech than it is of English.)</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SENTENCE ANALYSIS</div>


<h3>I<br />

<span class="smcap">Simple Sentences</span></h3>

<p>The material for logical analysis consists of little rolls
of fairly stiff paper, on which are printed simple, compound
and complex sentences, in carefully prepared series.</p>

<p>There is also a chart, divided into two columns of rectangular
spaces, with the name of one sentence element
printed in each space. The sentence read on the roll can
be torn off part by part, and each of these parts is placed
in one of the rectangles, according to the name printed on
it. This is another application of the compartment box
method used to analyze first the alphabet, then the sounds
which go to make up the word, finally the words as parts
of speech. Here, the compartments are reduced to a simple
design.</p>

<p>The charts for logical analysis are on colored paper and
are artistically drawn and decorated. We have charts of
four different kinds as regards ornament and color, for
such details exert a considerable influence upon the work
of the children. On the following page is a sample of the
charts with its "sections."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chart A</span></h3>



<div class="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="verbs and subjects">
<tr>
<td align="center">VERB<br /><br />(The verbal or nominal<br />predicate.)</td>
<td align="center">Who is it that?<br />What is it that?<br /><br />SUBJECT</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Who? What?<br /><br />(Direct object.)</td>
<td align="center">To whom? To what?<br /><br />(Indirect object.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">By Whom? By What<br /><br />(Agent.)</td>
<td align="center">Of whom? Of what?<br /><br />(Possessive, material.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">When?<br /><br />(Time.)</td>
<td align="center">Where?<br /><br />(Place.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Whence?<br /><br />(Source.)</td>
<td align="center">How?<br /><br />(Manner.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Why?<br /><br />(Cause.)</td>
<td align="center">What for?<br /><br />(Purpose.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">By means of whom?<br />By means of what?<br /><br />(Instrument.)</td>
<td align="center">With whom? <br />With what?<br /><br />(Accompaniment.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">(Attributive (phrases).)</td>
<td align="center">(Vocative.)</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>The two spaces at the top, subject and predicate, are
somewhat larger and are more conspicuously decorated than
the other rectangles below. The words <i>subject</i> and
<i>verb</i> are printed entirely in large capitals. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a><br /><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
spaces, however, are much more simply decorated and the
words are in small letters. This helps to distinguish the
principal from the secondary elements in the sentences.
The names of the parts of speech, and the questions which
bring out the meaning of these names, are in different
colors: for instance, the names may be black and the
questions red, or the names may be in red and the questions
in green. And the letters of the questions are larger
than the letters of the names, except in the two upper
spaces, where the words <i>subject</i> and <i>verb</i> are in the largest
type.</p>

<p>The child begins to see what a sentence is: that is, he
begins to <i>concentrate</i> on this particular question. How
many times he has read sentences, pronounced sentences,
composed sentences! But now he is examining them in
detail, <i>studying</i> them. The simple sentence is a short
proposition, with completed meaning, which expresses an
action or a situation, organizing its different parts around
a <i>verb</i>.</p>

<p>The first exercise for the child must be to find the verb, a
task not very difficult after the preceding exercises on the
parts of speech have been performed. When he has found
the verb, it becomes essential for him to find the subject.
The subject may be found by asking the question: <i>Who
is it that</i>&mdash;? For example:</p>

<div class='indent'>
The child reads.<br />
</div>

<p>The word <i>reads</i> is the verb. The section of the roll
where the word <i>reads</i> appears is torn off and placed in the
space marked <i>Verb</i>. Then ask: "<i>Who is it that</i> reads?"
The answer is, "<i>The child</i> reads." The section containing
the word <i>the child</i> is torn off and placed in the space
marked <i>Subject</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Another sentence: on the roll the child finds written:</p>

<div class='indent'>
<i>The glass is broken.</i><br />
</div>

<p>The teacher can briefly explain that the verb taken by
itself, has no special meaning. <i>Is</i> means nothing! "<i>Is?</i>
Is <i>what?</i>" Some attribute must be added: "Is
<i>broken!</i>" Here we get a <i>nominal predicate</i>. When the
verb contains some definite meaning in terms of action,
for instance <i>reads</i>, we get a <i>verbal predicate</i>. The section
of the roll containing <i>is broken</i> is torn off, accordingly,
and placed in the space of the verb. But <i>what</i> is
broken? <i>The glass!</i> The section containing the words
<i>the glass</i> is placed in the space of the subject. All of this
can be copied off by the child by hand, as follows:</p>

<div class='indent'>
Simple sentence: The child reads.<br />
The child: Subject.<br />
Reads: Predicate (verbal).<br />
</div>

<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series I</span><br />

(Simple Sentences)</div>

<p>The first roll contains the following simple sentences
without modifiers of any kind:</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;The child reads.<br />
&mdash;The glass is broken.<br />
&mdash;Charles is tall.<br />
&mdash;The trees are blossoming.<br />
&mdash;The blackboard is clean.<br />
&mdash;Who has come?<br />
&mdash;The pencil is broken.<br />
&mdash;The sky is blue.<br />
&mdash;I am reading.<br />
&mdash;I am studying.<br />
&mdash;The children are playing.<br />
&mdash;Time flies.<br />
&mdash;The teacher sings.<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series II</span><br />

(Simple Sentences, containing a few modifiers)</div>

<p>The roll contains the following sentences, written one
after another:</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;The mother loves her child dearly.<br />
&mdash;Johnny brought his teacher a rose.<br />
&mdash;You may keep the book for some days, Louis.<br />
&mdash;Mary, give the poor man a penny.<br />
&mdash;Where have you been, Mary?<br />
&mdash;I will do it, mother.<br />
&mdash;Little Harry, only three years old, has cleaned the whole blackboard.<br />
&mdash;Who drew the pretty picture?<br />
&mdash;Last night I showed the letter to father.<br />
&mdash;In the yard a red white and blue flag is waving.<br />
&mdash;Did you go to the theater last night?<br />
&mdash;The rain was beating against the window panes.<br />
&mdash;The dog is barking at the cat.<br />
&mdash;The poor deaf-mutes talk with their hands.<br />
</div>

<p>Example of application: The section containing the
first sentence,</p>

<div class='center'>
The mother loves her child dearly.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>is first torn off from the roll. Then the section containing
the word <i>loves</i> is placed in the space marked <i>verb</i>.
<i>Who</i> loves?&mdash;<i>the mother</i>. The section containing the
words <i>the mother</i> is placed in the space marked <i>subject</i>.
The mother loved <i>whom?</i> <i>Her child.</i> The section containing
<i>her child</i> is torn off and placed in the space marked
<i>direct object</i>. By thus reading the names printed in the
spaces of the chart the child learns to classify the various
kinds of modifiers. <i>How</i> does the mother love her child?
<i>In what manner?</i> <i>Dearly.</i> The section containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
word <i>dearly</i> is placed in the space marked <i>Manner</i> and the
sentence is completed.</div>

<p>Now the child can copy off these analyses immediately
or make others, as he thinks best. The copy may be as
follows:</p>

<div class='indent'>
The mother loves her child dearly.<br />
The mother: Subject.<br />
Loves: Predicate (verbal).<br />
Her child: Direct object.<br />
Dearly: Adverb, manner.<br />
</div>

<p>In classifying the vocatives and attributives, a little
help from the teacher may be required. Example:</p>

<div class='indent'>
You may keep the book for some days, Louis.<br />
</div>

<p>The word <i>Louis</i> can be dramatized somewhat into a kind
of invocation, as&mdash;<i>O Louis, you may keep the book</i> and
so on. Vocatives can almost always be identified by trying
the exclamatory <i>O</i> before them.</p>

<p>In the sentence,</p>

<div class='hang2'>Little Harry, only three years old, has cleaned the whole
blackboard.</div>

<div class='unindent'><i>only three years old</i> is an attributive of Harry. It should
be torn off and placed in the space marked <i>Attributive</i>.</div>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series III</span><br />

(Simple sentences with two or more modifiers of the same
kind)</div>

<p>The roll contains the following sentences in sections
which may be read and torn off one after the other as the
child unrolls the strip:</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;The child sleeps and dreams.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&mdash;Everybody likes fruit and flowers.<br />
&mdash;He took paper, pen and ink to write to his friends.<br />
&mdash;Charles opened and closed the book.<br />
&mdash;The doctor and the father left the sick child's room.<br />
&mdash;The women recommended calmness, patience and prudence.<br />
&mdash;In the beginning God created heaven and earth.<br />
&mdash;He will always have money and friends.<br />
&mdash;In the street we could see crowds of men and a few women.<br />
</div>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series IV</span><br />

(Elliptical sentences with subject understood)</div>

<p>[This situation does not however arise in English, which,
save in the imperative, always requires at least a pronominal
subject for the verb.]</p>

<p>Here, the child interprets the sentence, completing it
and finding the element that is lacking.</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;La ringrazio (<i>I</i> thank you).<br />
&mdash;Verrete? (Will <i>you</i> come?)<br />
&mdash;Sono stanco (<i>I</i> am tired).<br />
&mdash;Non mi sento bene oggi (<i>I</i> don't feel well to-day).<br />
&mdash;Com'è andata? (How did <i>it</i> turn out?)<br />
&mdash;Dico la verità (<i>I</i> will tell you all about it).<br />
&mdash;Siamo contentissimi (<i>We</i> are delighted).<br />
&mdash;Vi saluto (<i>I</i> bid you good-by).<br />
&mdash;Vado a casa (<i>I</i> am going home).<br />
&mdash;Lampeggia (<i>It</i> is lightening).<br />
&mdash;M'impose silenzio (<i>He</i> told me to say nothing).<br />
&mdash;Ascolto (<i>I</i> am listening).<br />
</div>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series V</span><br />

(Elliptical sentences where the predicate is understood)</div>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;Silence!<br />
&mdash;Why all this noise?<br />
&mdash;After me, the deluge!<br />
&mdash;The sooner the better!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&mdash;Good luck to you, sir!<br />
&mdash;What nasty weather!<br />

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Order of Elements in the Sentence:
Permutations</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'>Rules:</div>

<p>The English (the Italian) language tends to follow the
direct order in prose, inversion being very rare.</p>

<p>In poetry, inversion is very common.</p>

<p>The direct order consists in placing: first, the subject,
then the predicate, then the objects, direct and indirect;
then the modifiers follow according to the importance they
derive from the meaning of the sentence.</p>

<p>These ideas are after all so simple and clear that the
child rarely has any difficulty in understanding them.
Nevertheless, it is much easier to give the child a vivid
impression of them by the permutation of parts than by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
explanation. This permutation is made very convenient
by the sentences being printed in sections which may be
moved about and combined at will. Just as the sequence
of the various parts of speech was made clear by transposing
the parts, here the same result can be accomplished
by transposing the sections of the printed slip. Example:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="sentence">
<tr>
<td align="center">We</td>
<td align="center">heard</td>
<td align="center">the clatter</td>
<td align="center">of the horse's hoofs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">&nbsp; &nbsp;(subject)&nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="center">&nbsp; &nbsp;(predicate) &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="center">&nbsp; &nbsp;(direct object) &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="center">&nbsp; &nbsp;(attribute)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" colspan='2'>on the pavement.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" colspan='2'>&nbsp; &nbsp;(place: adverb)</td>
</tr>

</table></div>


<p>The following combinations are possible results of permutation:</p>

<blockquote><p>We&mdash;heard&mdash;the clatter&mdash;of the horse's hoofs&mdash;on the
pavement.</p>

<p>We&mdash;the clatter&mdash;heard&mdash;on the pavement&mdash;of the horse's
hoofs.</p>

<p>We&mdash;of the horse's hoofs&mdash;on the pavement&mdash;the clatter&mdash;heard.</p>

<p>Of the horse's hoofs&mdash;on the pavement&mdash;heard&mdash;the clatter&mdash;we,
etc., etc.</p></blockquote>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series VIII</span><br />

(The inverted order)</div>

<p>The effect of direct and inverted order can be shown
in every sentence. But it is better to try examples of inversion
from poetic language. In this series, all the sentences
show inversion of one type or another:</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.</span><br />
<br />
&mdash;Upon the roof we sat that night!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The noise of bells went sweeping by;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awesome bells they were to me.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&mdash;Still sits the school-house by the road.<br />
<br />

<p>Exercises on the putting together of sentence elements
can lead to practise in the identification and use of grammatical
forms as parts of speech, which the study of single
words would not at first permit; as for instance, forms of
the verbs used as nouns (infinitive and gerund as subject
and object), the difference between personal pronouns used
as direct or indirect objects, and so on.</p>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series IX</span><br />

(The forms of the verb)</div>

<p>The roll contains the two forms of the verb, active and
passive, in sections. The analysis is conducted on the

<p>The exercise in permutation brings out the relative positions
of the direct and indirect objects; as also the conditions
under which the preposition <i>to</i> is required before
the indirect object.</p>


<h3>II<br />

<span class="smcap">Compound and Complex Sentences</span></h3>

<p>Here we are dealing with a number of propositions
(clauses) which combine into one complete meaning. The
clauses fit together in the sentences just as did the various
elements in the simple sentence. The material for the analysis
is therefore analogous to that used in the analysis of
the simple sentence: strips of paper in rolls on which are
written the sentences to be analyzed, and a chart with
spaces where the detached pieces may be placed, according
to the designation of these spaces.</p>

<p>The principal space on the chart is reserved for the
main clause, around which the other clauses are arranged,
as coordinate or subordinate.</p>

<p>Since the work of logical analysis of the complex sentence
is sufficiently interesting to attract the attention of
the child to various forms of study, the material contains
in addition to the rolls and the chart, a number of test-cards
where the analysis is completed and logically demonstrated.
These cards serve as tests of the accuracy of
the work done by the children, and as actual charts for
analytical study. Of course, when the child is doing his
exercise with the strips of paper and the chart, he does
not have these test-cards before him. He should, however,
always have free access to them. His interest in the
game is to succeed by himself in placing the different propositions
where they belong.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series I</span><br />

(Compound Sentences)</div>

<p>The clauses are independent of each other. Each contains
a complete meaning, and each therefore could stand
alone. It is a question of simple sentences <i>coordinated</i>
with each other.</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;I hunted carefully everywhere and at last I found it.<br />
&mdash;She started in fear, lifted her face and shaded it from the strong sun.<br />
&mdash;The bees hummed in the warm sunshine and the cat sat purring at her side.<br />
&mdash;She dropped her sewing and went to the door.<br />
&mdash;The girl covered her eyes with her hands and wept.<br />
&mdash;They looked into each other's faces: each of them had a question to ask and neither dared to speak.<br />
&mdash;I am a lowly peasant and you are a gallant knight.<br />
&mdash;They all looked at the speaker, and crowded round him and waited for his next word to attack him.<br />
&mdash;Then he began to weep and he tore his hair in anguish.<br />
&mdash;Louis clapped his hands for joy and began to dance around the room.<br />
&mdash;He looked into the mirror, straightened his tie, smoothed his hair and went out to greet his two friends.<br />
&mdash;She went to the window and looked out over the stormy sea.<br />
</div>

<p>The child divides these sentences into clauses, analyzing
each separately. Then, placing one under the other, he
is impressed by the fact that each has a complete meaning
and can stand by itself; save that in English the subject
of the first clause is often carried over to the second:</p>

<div class='indent'>

<br />

<i>and</i> went out to meet his two friends.<br />
<br />
The bees hummed in the warm sunshine.<br />
And the cat sat purring at her side.<br />
<br />
Then he began to weep.<br />
And he tore his hair in anguish.<br />

The girl covered her face with her hands.<br />

<p>Here only the main clause has a complete meaning.

<p>In the preceding roll, the subordinate clauses completed
the meaning and constituted an attribute of <i>one word</i> of
the principal clause. Here, however, the subordinate
clauses refer to the whole content of the main clause and
complete <i>the whole thought</i> of the main clause. They
have, therefore, a logical dependence on the main clause.
The child will be guided in finding the place of the different
subordinate clauses and in classifying them according
to the designations of the spaces by the questions which
appear in the analytical chart. It is presupposed that he
can readily identify the main clause itself.</p>

(The Order of Clauses in Sentences:<br />
Sentence Forms in Prose and Verse)</div>

<p>Our material makes it very easy for the children to
understand the mutual dependence of the subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
clauses. We take the commonest cases within easy reach
of the children. There are clauses of the first degree of
subordination, dependent directly on the principal clause.
There are others of the second degree of subordination
which depend on a subordinate clause (clause subordinate
to a subordinate). We have the same situation in coordinates.
We have the first degree of coordination when
the clause is parallel with the principal clause, and the
second degree when the clause is parallel with a subordinate
clause.</p>

<p>Since the slips have as many sections as there are
clauses, the clauses may be arranged on the table in the
order of their subordination, keeping, for example, the
principal clause to the left, and arranging the subordinate
clauses downward and downward to the right. Take, for
instance, the sentence:</p>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The old man liked to tell stories; and he would laugh
heartily when the women were frightened at the terrible
things that he had to relate.</div>

principal clause to the right of the first arrow; the first
subordinate clause to the right of the second; the subordinate
to the subordinate to the right of the third, and so on.

<div class='unindent'>In using this material, the child tears off the clause-slips
using the analytical sentence-chart (Chart B). This gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
him the classification of the clauses. The strips are then
to be placed on the dependence chart (Chart C) according
to the indications of the arrows. This brings out the
mutual relation of the clauses.</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Permutations</span></h3>

<p>The preceding exercises have created in the child a
notion of sentence construction and of the position of the
clauses which make it up. Our material permits, of
course, as an exercise supplementary to the analyses, dislocations
and translocations of parts just as was true with
the simple sentence. To derive the full benefit of this
possibility, the teacher should have in mind the general
rules for location of clauses:</p>

<p>Adjective clauses (relative, attributive) always follow,
and most often directly, the noun they modify.</p>

<p>Subject subordinate clauses may stand either before or
after the principal clause. If the subject clause follows,
it is usually anticipated before the verb by the pronoun it
(just as a following noun subject is anticipated by <i>there</i>).</p>

<p>(In Italian, if the object clause precedes the main
clause, it is usually repeated before the noun by a conjunctive
object personal pronoun.)</p>

<p>The position of the other clauses depends on considerations
of emphasis.</p>

<p>The direct order for complex sentences is in general
similar to that for simple sentences:</p>

<div class='list1'>
subject clause<br />
principal clause<br />
object clause<br />
adverbial clauses.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Coordination is possible with subordinate as well as with
principal clauses.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The special exercises on the complex sentence conclude
with some practise in turning simple inversions as found
in poetry into direct sentence order.</p>

<p>The detachable strips are used here also. The exercise
should be conducted with reference to the sentence charts.</p>

<p>(Note: the best English poetry makes far less use of
inversion than does Italian. Such exercises as the above
could be profitably applied to the analysis of the different
kinds of phrases (adjective, adverbial, etc.). It should
be noted that Dr. Montessori in her own exercises treats
verbal phrases (participles and infinitives) as subordinate
clauses.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr.</span>)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coordinating and Subordinating Conjunctions</span></h3>

<p>This study of the complex sentence leads the child to a
more precise comprehension of the values of certain parts
of speech as, notably, the conjunction. We have found, in
fact, that little difficulty is experienced in realizing the
distinction between the terms <i>coordinating</i> and <i>subordinating</i>
as applied to conjunctions which <i>unite</i> clauses but in
different ways. The following charts serve to cover the
vast majority of cases that the child is likely to meet. We
may add that at this point it may be found useful to have
the child analyze the complex sentences which appeared in
the commands and readings already familiar to him (see
below under <i>Reading</i>).</p>


<div class='subsection'>COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Copulatives:</i> and, also, too, besides, moreover, further, furthermore,
nor.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Disjunctives:</i> or else, otherwise, rather.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Adversatives:</i> but, nevertheless, however, notwithstanding, yet,

<div class='chaptertitle'>PUNCTUATION</div>


<p>The permutations of clauses permitted by our materials
give empirical evidence of the pauses and accordingly of
the functions of the orthographical signs of suspense in the
sentence. These signs are included also in our alphabets.
All the exercises hitherto given require more or less spontaneous
attention to punctuation. We offer, however, in
addition, several series of sentences for analysis in illustration
of the principal rules for the use of punctuation
points. Almost all of our Italian sentences are taken
from Manzoni, a writer especially noteworthy for his care
in punctuation. (The majority of the sentences below are
taken from the <i>Book of Knowledge</i>, by special permission
of the publishers.)</p>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series I</span></div>

<p>The comma may separate coordinate elements.</p>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The mother took a glowing pride in the beauty of her children's
faces, the grace and strength of their bodies, their
reckless daring and unflinching courage.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The little star fell plump into the middle of a big puddle, and
there it lay sad and shaken and quaking with fright.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;It was dumb and half blind, it had a soiled face, and could

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;A mouse was just then peeping from its hole to see whether

<p>In this series should be given dialogues, interesting

<div class='chaptertitle'>WORD CLASSIFICATION</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Kinds of Words</span></h3>

<p>In doing the work outlined thus far, the children have
acquired considerable resources in vocabulary. They
have seen all the articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions,
interjections, many of the adverbs; and they know
many nouns, adjectives, and verbs, which will be increased
in number as their culture is widened. They know something
also of the use of the parts of speech and their functions
in the expression of thought. This is the natural
place for a classification in retrospect of those words which
the children have in writing before them on the cards and
slips of different colors. Separate tables should be used
for these exercises in word grouping.</p>

<p>This new step is preparatory to a <i>theoretical study</i> of
language to be developed in later courses in the second

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EXPRESSION AND INTERPRETATION</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mechanical Processes</span></h3>

<p>Reading begins in the "Children's House" as soon
as the children <i>reread</i> the word they have already composed
with the movable alphabet. This early effort is
not indeed the true reading of the word, since interpretation
is lacking. The children, it has been seen, know
the word because they have actually put it together. They
have not gained an understanding of it from the simple
recognition of the graphic symbols. What they have done
is, nevertheless, an important contribution to real reading.
As one considers all of the details of this period of
development, it is apparent that its mechanism is closely
allied with that of the spoken language.</p>

<p>When the child's attention has been intensively applied
to the recognition of the written word, it can easily be
fixed on the analysis of the sounds which make up the
word. At a certain age the child's interest was aroused
by "touching" the letter. He can now be interested in
hearing the sounds of the word when pronounced by others
and in pronouncing it himself. We have shown that the
work on the written language in the exercises with the
alphabet was <i>necessary</i> for developing and perfecting the
spoken language. It is by so doing that we make it possible
to correct defects in speech and to pass naturally over
the period when such defects are formed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>We now aim at finding an <i>exercise</i> in the actual mechanism
of pronunciation which can be started at the moment
of its natural development in such a way that its growth
to perfection will follow as a matter of course. It is a
question of bringing the children rapidly to pronounce
without hesitation. In so pronouncing well, in performing
extensive exercises in hearing words and in the interpretation
of them from graphic signs, the child brings
together in a unit of effect the basic processes of reading
and writing.</p>

<p>A good pronunciation of the word read is of great importance.
We may say that in the elementary schools of
our day this is the principal purpose of reading. Nevertheless,
it is very difficult to obtain a good pronunciation
when defects have been allowed to develop and become
habitual in the child's previous work. In fact, the elimination
of these defects, which have been the result of a
fundamental error in education, comes to absorb all of the
energies of the reading class in ordinary primary schools.
So far along as the fifth grade we see teachers struggling
to make the children read, that they may acquire a good
"pronunciation," and in our reading books there are graduated
exercises constructed on the basis of "Difficulties in
Pronunciation." It is apparent that all of this stress on
the <i>physiological mechanics</i> of pronunciation is foreign to
<i>true reading</i>. It is, rather, an impediment to the development
of true reading. Such reading exercises constitute,
as it were, a foreign body, which operates like a disease
to prevent the development of the high intellectual activity
which interprets the mysterious language of written
symbols and arouses the child's enthusiasm with the fascinating
revelations they can give. The eagerness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
child to learn is curbed and cheated when he is compelled
to stop his mind from working because his tongue refuses
to act properly and must be laboriously trained to work
right. This training, if begun at the proper time, when
the child's whole psychic and nervous organism yearns for
the perfection of the mechanism of speech, would have
been a fascinating task; and once started along the right
path, the pupil would have continued to follow it with
alacrity and confidence. When the time comes for the
intelligence to try its wings, its wings should be ready.
What would happen to a painter, if at the moment of inspiration,
he had to sit down and manufacture his
brushes!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Analysis</span></h3>

<p>Our first publication on the methods used in the "Children's
House" made clear two distinct operations involved
in reading: the interpretation of the meaning and
the pronunciation aloud of the "word." The stress we
laid on that analysis as a guide to the development of
reading was the result of actual experience. Those who
followed this work during its initial stages saw how the
children, when they read for the first time, interpreting
the meaning of the words before them, did so without
speaking,&mdash;reading, that is, mentally. Interpretation, in
fact, is a question of mental concentration. Reading is an
affair of the <i>intelligence</i>. The pronunciation aloud is
quite a different thing, not only distinguished from the
first process, but secondary to it. Talking aloud is a question
of speech, involving first hearing and then the mechanical
reproduction of sounds in articulate language.
Its function is to bring into immediate communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
two or more people, who thus exchange the thoughts
which they have already perfected in the secret places of
their minds.</p>

</div>

<p>But reading stands in a direct relation with writing.
Here there are no sounds to be heard or pronounced. The
individual, all by himself, can put himself into communication
not only with human beings actually alive on the
earth, but also with those who lived centuries and centuries
ago down to the dawn of history. Such communication
is made possible not by sound but by the written
symbol. The mind takes in these symbols in silence.
Books are mute, as far as sound is concerned.</p>

<p>It follows that reading aloud is a combination of two
distinct operations, of two "languages." It is something
far more complex than speaking and reading taken separately
by themselves. In reading aloud the child speaks
not to express his own thoughts, but thoughts revealed by
the written symbol. The "word" in this case no longer
has that natural stimulus from within which creation
gives it. In fact, it is something forced and monotonous,
something like the language of the deaf-mute. Words
which are the product of the interpretation of individual
alphabetical symbols come with effort, and the meaning
which comes from the interpretation of the entire sentence,
as the eye reads word by word, and translates into
sound, is apprehended and reduced to expression with
great difficulty. To give a fairly intelligible expression
to the meaning, the eyes have been obliged rapidly to
traverse the sentence as a whole, while the tongue has been
laboriously and monotonously pronouncing one word after
another. Just imagine adding to such a complex problem
for the child of the primary schools the additional task
of correcting his pronunciation! It is no wonder that
reading is one of the rocks on which the rudderless ship
of elementary education inevitably runs aground.</p>

<p>The experiments we have succeeded in conducting on
the subject of reading are perhaps among the most complete
we have made. We found the key to the problem
when we discovered that the child passed from the mental
reading of the words written on the cards directly to interpretation
in action. This interpretation, ready and
facile, as all the acts of children are, reveals to us what the
child has understood and accordingly what he is capable
of understanding. We have thus been able to obtain an
experimental graduation of passages for reading, which
on being gathered together, show the nature of the difficulties
which successively present themselves to the child.
The children have made for themselves specimen clauses
and sentences which an expert grammarian could not have
devised better for facilitating the study of language. As
we went on with this work, we became more and more convinced
that the study of grammar may be made a help in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a><br /><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the up-building of the child's language and that it makes
its influence felt in reading and in the written composition.
The table (<a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>) may be useful in showing the
successive steps actually traversed by the child in the
phenomena of reading.</p>

<p>The fundamental point to realize is that <i>interpretation</i>
alone constitutes true reading. Reading aloud, on the
other hand, is a combination of reading and articulate
expression, in other words, a combination involving the
two great mechanisms of the spoken language and the
written language. Reading aloud permits an audience to
take part in the reading communicated to it by means of
articulate speech. Even here, the mental effort required
to listen to the voice of a man passionately interested in
the narration of things which he himself has experienced
is not the same as that demanded in listening to a reading
of the same things by a person who has not experienced
them, and who, to narrate them, must perform the rapid
and intense effort of interpretation. In this reading, so
to speak, by "transmission," the most serious difficulties
are encountered. We all know by experience how difficult
it is to endure a reading, and how rare an endowment
the "gift of reading" is. However, the person who is
thus gifted can get a hearing almost as well as the person
who speaks. The teaching of reading, then, in this sense,
is not merely the teaching of the interpretation of the
meaning,&mdash;all that would be necessary, if the sole function
of reading were to gain new ideas for the reader.
Reading, thus conceived, represents really the addition
of an <i>art of expression</i> to simple reading, and since this
expressive art is purely dramatic, the <i>teaching of reading</i>
involves the development of <i>dramatic art</i>. Only through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dramatic art can the transmission of reading to a group
of people be made possible.</p>

<p>It is clear that the oftener the exercise of identifying
oneself with what is read is repeated and perfected, the
greater the possibility of expression becomes. It follows
that in the perfection of this art we should be less concerned
with <i>timbre</i>, with tone of voice and gestures, all
extrinsic aspects of this art, than with intense vivid <i>interpretation</i>
which brings the child to an identification
of himself with what he reads. And this interpretation
will realize its objects if it is practised as a habit and as
<i>a form of reading</i>.</p>

<p>The proof of correct interpretation was the child's
ability to reproduce in action what was described in the
words he read. Similarly, the proof of the interpretation
in reading aloud is the repetition of the things heard
by means of the spoken language. That is, the children,
in order to prove to us that they have understood something
read aloud, should be able to repeat in narrative
form what they have heard.</p>

<p>The practical results of our efforts in this direction were
very interesting to watch. Some children can say nothing.
Others offer to tell the whole story. Their story
is not clear or perhaps it is defective in some respect. Immediately
other children are ready to correct the ones
telling the story: "No, no, that's not what happened,
that's not what happened," or, "Wait, you have forgotten
something," and so on. In fact, to understand and to be
able to narrate what has been understood is not the same
thing. In telling a story there is a successive unfolding
of very complex mental activities which are based on and
added to the primal activity of "having understood." It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is a question again of the three different stages noted by us
in the first lessons given to children:</p>

<p><i>First stage</i>, the causing of the perception: (<i>That is
red, that is blue</i>);</p>

<p><i>Second stage</i>, the perfection of recognition: (<i>What is
red or blue?</i>);</p>

<p><i>Third stage</i>, the provocation of expression: (<i>What
about this or that?</i>).</p>

<p>Thus, the child who succeeds in expressing, even in an
imperfect way, what he has understood of the passage he
has read, is in a more advanced state of development than
other children who are unable to tell the story. However,
these children who are not able to relate what they have
heard said may very well be in the preceding stage in
which they are capable of "recognition." These latter
are the relentless critics, the constant "hecklers" of those
who are trying to relate&mdash;"No, no,&mdash;that's not so,"
"You have forgotten this, or that." Let one of us
teachers try to tell the story in the most perfect and complete
manner, and these tiny impetuous hecklers listen to
us in ecstasy, showing their approval in every form of
approbation of which they are capable. By studying such
manifestations in the children, we can get sufficient psychological
data for determining what reading is adapted to
children of different ages, the best ways of reading aloud,
and the line of development followed by each child in that
hidden mental world of his which is cut off from our gaze.
But to derive these benefits from reading, it is perfectly
clear that the children must be left absolutely <i>free</i> in the
expression of what goes on in their minds.</p>

<p>According to the method used in ordinary schools a child
is called upon to read aloud, and the teacher herself continually
interrupts, either to correct the pronunciation, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to assist by explanations and suggestions in the interpretation
of the meaning. This is all useless for experimental
purposes. We have no certain means of determining
whether the pupil has understood either what he has read
or the explanations of the teacher. Furthermore the corrections
of pronunciation have centered the child's attention
on this detail which is entirely without relation to
the meaning of the text he is interpreting. Another situation
not infrequently arises. A child is selected at random
to tell in his own words what he has been read. Often
the selection is not made at random, but some pupil is
called on because he has shown himself the most inattentive,
the least interested in what is being done&mdash;the recitation
thus becoming correctional in character! While
the child is telling his story, there is a constant suppression
of interruptions: "Hush, I did not call on you,"
"Wait till you are called on," "It is not polite to interrupt
some one who is talking," etc. It is clear that the
teacher will never learn anything about her pupils in this
way.</p>

<p>This explains why, from the psychological point of
view, our present-day schools have not been able to contribute
anything new to a reformed scientific pedagogy of
reading.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experimental Section: Reading Aloud</span></h3>

<p>Although we lay all possible stress on interpretative
reading, we nevertheless put into the hands of the child
a little reading book which he can go over by himself first
in a low voice, and then, when he has grasped the meaning,
aloud, provided he can express himself clearly and
easily.</p>

<p>The simplicity of these texts occasions surprise when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
one observes how completely and enthusiastically absorbed
in them the children become. They find them so delightful
that the books get literally worn out with the reading
and rereading to which they are subjected. Sometimes a
book is read from beginning to end. Again the child
opens it by chance and reads the page he happens on.
Some children like to read the whole book over and over.
Others prefer to read some particular page a great many
times. One frequently sees these tiny things suddenly
rise with great decision and read aloud one of the pages
which has been so seriously examined.</p>

<p>The little book was composed very carefully on the
basis of rigid experimentation. As the book is opened
only one page of print appears, the tergo of the right
hand page being always blank. Nor does the text always
cover the entire page. The spaces above and below the
print are decorated with designs.</p>

<p>The twenty pages of this beginners book are as follows:</p>

<div class='hang1'>Page 1. My school is the "Children's House."</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 2. In the "Children's House" there are ever so many
little chairs and tables for us.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 3. There are also some pretty cabinets. Each child has
his own drawer.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 4. There are green plants and beautiful bouquets of
flowers everywhere about the rooms in our school.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 5. I often stop to look at the pictures which are hanging
on the walls.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 6. We are busy all the time. We wash our faces and
hands. We keep everything where it belongs. We
dust the furniture. We study and try to learn all
we can.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 7. Can you guess how we learned to dress ourselves?
We kept our fingers busy working on the canvas
frames, lacing and unlacing, fastening and unfastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the hooks and eyes, buttoning and unbuttoning,
tying and untying knots.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 8. Then are ten blocks for this tower, all of different
sizes. First I spread them around on this carpet.
It is great fun to put them together again, taking
one after the other and choosing the largest each
time.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 9. I use the tower too in a balancing game. Just try
to carry the tower around the room without letting
it fall to pieces! Sometimes I succeed and then
again I sometimes fail.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 10. I like the long rods, too! I must put the rods near
each other according to their length. I must be
careful to place the blue sections near the blue ones
and the red ones near the red. Thus, I build
some pretty stairs with red and blue steps.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 11. But to get a real stair case I use the brown prisms.
These prisms are of different size, and I get some
fine stairs with ten steps.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 12. I have also some solid insets of wood into which I fit
little cylinders of different dimensions. They differ
in length and breadth. The game is to put
these cylinders in their places after looking at them
and touching them carefully.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 13. We often make mistakes in working with the insets.
When we put a cylinder where it doesn't belong,
we find that at the end of the game we have one
cylinder left over and it won't fit in anywhere.
Then the exercise becomes very exciting. We look
at the inset carefully; we find the mistake and begin
all over again. The most skilful pupils work
the insets with their eyes closed.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 14. These colors are called: red, black, green, yellow, blue,
brown, pink and violet.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 15. I amuse myself by picking out and pulling together
pieces of the same color from the collection spread
out over my table. I get thus a long strip of different
colors.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang1'>Page 16. We learn to arrange sixty-four different colors by
graduations. We get eight beautiful blends of
colors, each formed by eight tints of different tones.
When we become skilful we can make a pretty rug
with blending strips.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 17. We also have two little chests full of pieces of cloth.
The cloths are of all kinds from the roughest and
hardest to the smoothest and softest: canvas, cotton,
linen, wool, flannel, velvet, etc. If we keep
our hands clean, we can learn to recognize all sorts
of things with the tips of our fingers!</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 18. A child is blindfolded. He mixes the pieces of cloth
with his little hands. He feels about among the
pieces of cloth. At last he smiles and holds up his
hands with two pieces of cloth, both alike. Though
he could not see, the child has found out, just by
using his fingers, that the two pieces were of the
same cloth.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 19. These are my plane insets. Here are the blue tablets.
I must fit them into the frames, which have just
enough room for them. I run two fingers, the fore-finger
and the middle-finger, around the edge of
the tablet, and then around the edge of the frames.
Next I fit the tablet into its proper place. After
a little practise I can put the six tablets in their
places even with my eyes blindfolded.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Page 20. With the plane insets I have learned to recognize
many figures: the square, the circle, the rectangle,
the ellipse, the triangle, the oval, the pentagon, the
hexagon, the heptagon, the octagon, the enneagon,
the decagon. I learned all these hard names very
easily because the insets are so amusing!</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Interpretations</span></h3>

<p>Reading with the object of interpretation is conducted
as in the first experiments of the "Children's House,"
with cards. From the graduated series we have prepared
the child selects a card. He reads it mentally and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
executes the action indicated on the card. Our later experiments
became very interesting when they were based
upon a more rigorous method. When we gave a card describing
two actions to a child of five years, he would
execute only one of the actions. Take the following for
example:</p>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;She leaned over the back of a chair.<br />
&mdash;She covered her face with her hands and wept.<br />
</div>
<div class='unindent'>The child would act out either the first sentence (<i>She
leaned over the back of the chair</i>) or the second (<i>She
covered her face with, her hands and wept</i>). In spite
of the fact that this child seemed extraordinarily eager
to get the cards into his hands and to interpret them, those
containing two sentences always aroused in him less enthusiasm
than those containing a single sentence or indicating
a single action (for instance, <i>The boy ran away
as fast as he could</i>). In this latter case the enthusiasm
of the little ones, their care in interpreting the action
vividly, their eagerness to repeat it, their flushed faces
and shining eyes, told us that at last we had the reading
adapted to their psychology.</div>

<p>Our <i>first series</i> of readings accordingly is entirely
"tested" or <i>experimental</i>. It is made up of simple sentences
something like those analyzed in the lessons on
grammar (Verb to Pronoun).</p>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series I</span></div>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;She gazed slowly around the room.<br />
&mdash;He looked at them out of the corners of his eyes.<br />
&mdash;The boy ran away as fast as he could.<br />
&mdash;She threw herself on her knees before him.<br />
&mdash;The man paced slowly up and down the room.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&mdash;The little girl stood with lowered head.<br />
&mdash;The teacher nodded her approval.<br />
&mdash;The little child sat with folded arms.<br />
&mdash;He started rapidly toward the door.<br />
&mdash;He began to walk to and fro about the room.<br />
&mdash;His mother tenderly stroked his head.<br />
&mdash;She motioned to him to keep away.<br />
&mdash;He whispered in her ear.<br />
&mdash;She placed her hand on his shoulder.<br />
&mdash;They knocked at the door.<br />
&mdash;The little girl frowned.<br />
</div>

<p>The children carry out the indicated action after they
have read mentally, but they put what amounts to artistic
expression into their interpretations, which are never
executed listlessly. For them it becomes a real "interpretation."
They often "study" the action, trying it
over and over again, as though rehearsing for a play.
Their aptitude for this is something remarkable.
Furthermore the words have, for the most part, already
been studied in the grammatical exercises, so that the
meaning of each word is becoming more and more clear.
This helps in the interpretation. For example, the sentence
<i>The little girl stood with lowered head</i> does not
mean simply "she lowered her head." If the child has
understood he will stand for some time with lowered head
in an attitude more or less expressive according to the
vividness of his feeling of the situation. In the sentence
<i>She threw herself on her knees before him</i> there will not
be a simple act of kneeling, but something more dramatic.
The child will assume the kneeling posture with some indication
of emotion. The children take no end of interest
in each other's interpretations.</p>

<p>In a <i>second series</i> of readings we have two coordinated
clauses, the children executing two consecutive actions instead
of one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series II</span></div>

<div class='indent'>
&mdash;He opened the door and came in.<br />
&mdash;He left the room and locked the door behind him.<br />
&mdash;He went on tiptoe to the door and carefully opened it.<br />
&mdash;She covered her face with her hands and began to sob violently.<br />
&mdash;She gave a cry of joy and ran to the door.<br />
&mdash;She burst into a laugh and clapped her hands.<br />
&mdash;He took off his cap and made a low bow.<br />
&mdash;She shook her head sadly and smiled.<br />
&mdash;He threw the window wide open and looked into the garden.<br />
&mdash;He hurried to the table and rang the bell.<br />
&mdash;With a sigh of relief he stretched himself out on the sofa, and lay there looking at the ceiling with his mouth open.<br />
&mdash;He shut his eyes and fell asleep.<br />

coordinate clauses.</p>

above her head, so that the light shone upon her face.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;She advanced holding forward her head as if she would have
him kiss her as he used to when she was a child; but then
remembering herself, she made him a deep curtsy, sweeping
down to the ground almost, looking up meanwhile with
the sweetest smile.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;She closed the door very carefully behind her, and then leant
back against it, her hands folded before her, looking at the
boy who was kneeling beside his trunk to pack it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;He took the paper and stepped to the window; then holding
the sheet so that the light fell full upon it, he examined it
carefully, folded it as though musing on its contents and
put it into his vest pocket.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;My Lord was lifting the glass to his lips, when Esmond entered;
but at the sight of the familiar face, the movement
of his arm ceased when the glass was on a level with his
chin; he held it there a moment in astonishment, then,
suddenly setting it on the table he rushed toward Esmond
with outstretched arms, and would almost have embraced
him: "I thought you were in France," he exclaimed.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The Prince was lying on the bed, but at the sound of the
footsteps, he rose on his elbow in alarm, while he reached
under the pillow for his pistols: "Who goes there?" he
shouted sternly.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The child playfully drew his cap down over his eyes as though
he were a very fierce bandit, and rushed into the room
holding out his arm and pointing his fore-finger like a
pistol.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;As the ladies rode up, the old gentleman raised his hat and
stood with bowed head till they had passed.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The young man picked up the glove from the floor, pressed it
fervently to his lips and clasped it tenderly against his
bosom, as though it were a priceless treasure.</div>

(More difficult interpretations with occasional speaking)</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Dunsey threw himself into a chair by the window, drew another
chair before him, threw one leg over it, and began to
beat on the window sill with the points of his fingers.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Godfrey stood with his back to the fire, moving his fingers
uneasily among the contents of his side-pockets and looking
at the floor.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Aaron replied by rubbing his head against his mother's skirt,
passing the backs of his hands over his eyes and peeping
through his fingers at Master Marner.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Mr. Macey screwed up his mouth, leaned his head further on
one side and twirled his thumbs rapidly, with his two
hands resting on his lap and touching at the finger-tips.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Silas sat with his elbows on his knees, his forehead pressed
rigidly into his two palms, his eyes closed, deep sighs that
were almost groans shaking his slender frame.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;The little tot squatted on the coat and spread out her hands
to the fire; but the little eyes refused to stay open, and
finally the golden head sank down upon the floor fast asleep.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Presently the child slipped from his knee and began to walk
about; but suddenly she fell into a sitting posture and
began to pull at her little boots, as though she were trying
to get at her toes.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;"At last," he said, stretching back in the arm chair, crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a><br /><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
his legs and joining his hands behind his head: "I can
now have a minute to myself!"</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;"Ssshh," said the boy, frowning, and waving his right arm
with hand outspread towards his companion.</div>


<div class='subsection'><span class="smcap">Series VII</span><br />

(Interpretation requiring more than one person)</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;As Rip Van Winkle approached the town, the people all
stared at him with marks of surprise and invariably stroked
their chins, so that Rip was induced involuntarily to do
likewise: his beard was a foot long.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;A self-important old gentleman pushed through the crowd,
shoving the people to the right and left with his elbows as
he passed; and planting himself before Van Winkle, with
one hand on his side, the other resting on his cane, he demanded
with an austere tone: "What are you doing
here?"</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;As Rip Van Winkle told his story, the bystanders began to
look at each other, nod, and wink significantly and tap
their fingers against their foreheads.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;An old woman came tottering forward, put her hand to her
brow and peering under it into his face for a moment, exclaimed:
"Sure enough, it is Rip Van Winkle!"</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;As the Emperor stepped into the court-yard, the ladies were
all so busy crowding about the young prince, holding his
hands and counting the kisses, that they did not see the
old gentleman: "What's all this, what's all this?" he
shouted in rage; and they all scampered off in every direction.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;Trotty sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed;
he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and cried; he
got out of his chair and hugged Med; he got out of his
chair and hugged Richard; he got out of his chair and
hugged them both at once. He was constantly getting up
and sitting down, never stopping in his chair a single
minute, being beside himself with joy.</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;"Here, little girl, can you tell us the way to town?" "That's
not the way. The town is over in this direction!" But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
as the little girl was turning to point out the road, one of
the men seized her by the waist and lifted her from the
ground. Lucia looked back over her shoulder terrified and
gave a shriek. (Manzoni.)</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>(The children were delighted with this little action and rehearsed
it over and over again.)</p></div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;With a start, Evangeline looked wildly about her: "Where
is Gabriel?" she asked dazedly. "Where is Gabriel?
Where is Gabriel?" "He is on that ship that is just
sailing out of the harbor!" some one answered. For a
few moments Evangeline stood shading her eyes with her
palm, gazing after the vessel, fast disappearing into the
horizon. At last she spoke half aloud: "I will follow
you and find you wherever they may take you, Gabriel,"
she said, as though taking a vow. Then she turned to the
soldier and said: "Lead on to the boat, I am coming. I am coming."</div>

<div class='hang2'>&mdash;"Give me the bow," said Tell. Tell chose two arrows: one
he fitted to the bow-string, the other he thrust into his
girdle. Then for a moment he stood, a little bowed of
shoulder, with his eyes downward: he was praying. You
might have heard a leaf fall, so still was the place. Then
Tell raised his head; his eyes were steady, his hands had
become still; his face was like iron; he brought the cross
bow to his shoulder and laid his eye to the feather of the
shaft: "Twang," the apple fell. A cheer arose from the
crowd. Tell laid his hand upon the arrow in his girdle.
"If the first had hurt my child," he said, "this one by now
would have been through your heart, O Gessler!"</div>

<p>The children by no means restrict themselves to acting
out these little scenes and poses. In a second stage they
read aloud all these slips which they have interpreted, and
in view of the preparation they have had, their reading
shows considerable power of expression. They tend to
read the slips over and over again, many times, and not
infrequently commit them to memory. To take advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of this new activity we got together a number of
poems, making up a little book of children's verse. The
pupils read them both mentally and aloud, ultimately
committing them to memory and reciting them. Here
are some specimens of our Italian collection:</p>

<p>After this preparation the children are able to "understand"
what they read. All their difficulties in grasping
the sentences and their most complicated constructions
have been overcome. They have an insight into the grammatical
form of language; and the construction of a sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as well as the meaning of the words in it, interests
them. There has been created within them a fund of suppressed
energy which will very soon break forth into intense
activity. In fact, in our school, after these exercises
the passion for reading began to show itself. The
children wanted "reading, reading, more reading." We
got together hastily a few books but never enough to satisfy
the eagerness of the children. We found a surprising
lack of reading for little children in Italian. The
American system of opening special rooms in public
libraries for the use of little readers seems to me an excellent
thing.</p>

<p>But to take full advantage of this awakened enthusiasm
for reading and to cultivate at the same time the art of
reading aloud we must not neglect another element in
reading: audition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Audition</span></h3>

<p>When the child has advanced to some extent in the
exercises of interpretation, the teacher may begin reading
aloud. This should be done as artistically as possible.
We recommend for the training of teachers not only a
considerable artistic education in general but special attention
to the art of reading. One of the differences between
the traditional teacher of the past and the teachers
we should like to create is that the former used to speak
of an "art of teaching," which consisted of various devices
to make the child learn, in spite of itself, what the
teacher wanted to teach. Our teachers, rather, should be
<i>cultivators</i> of the fine arts. For in our method art is considered
a <i>means to life</i>. It is beauty in all its forms which
helps the inner man to grow. We have repeatedly emphasized
that both in the environment at school and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the materials used, everything should be carefully considered
in its artistic bearings, to provide ample room for
development for all the phenomena of attention and persistence
in work which are the secret keys of self-education.
The Montessori teacher should be a cultivator of music,
drawing and elocution, responsive to the harmony of
things; she must, that is, have sufficient "good taste" to
be able to lay out the school plant and keep it in condition;
and sufficient delicacy of manner&mdash;the product of a sensitive
nature&mdash;to be alive to all the manifestations of the
child spirit.</p>

<p>In the matter of reading aloud the teacher has an important
task to accomplish. We found the drawing hour best
adapted for this work. It was our experience that it is
easier to gain a hearing when the children are busy with
something which does not require great concentration and
which is not sustained by any particular inspiration.
During the drawing lesson, in the placid silence which
comes from work, and while the children are intent on
their designs, the teacher may begin her reading aloud.
It sometimes happens that the substance of what she reads
will be sufficient to engage the interest of the whole school.
But this is not always an easy task. It is more often the
musical quality of the teacher's execution which will attract
the little ones with a sense for art and bring them to
that motionless attention which is the evidence of eager
enjoyment. Possibly a really perfect reader might be able
so to hold the whole group of children with some absorbing
selection.</p>

<p>The readings we used were numerous and of great variety:
fairy tales, short stories, anecdotes, novels, historical
episodes. Specifically there were the tales of Andersen,
some of the short stories of Capuana, the <i>Cuore</i> of De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Amicis, episodes of the life of Jesus, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>,
<i>The Betrothed</i> (<i>I promessi sposi</i> of Manzoni), <i>Fabiola</i>,
stories from the Italian wars for independence (Nineteenth
Century), Itard's <i>Education of the Young Savage of
Aveyron</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Most Popular Books</span></h3>

<p>In general the child will listen to anything that is really
interesting. But certainly some surprises will be occasioned
by our discovery that the children liked above everything
else the readings on Italian history and the <i>Education
of the Savage of Aveyron</i>. The phenomenon is
sufficiently curious to merit further consideration. The
history we used was not one commonly thought adapted
to young readers. Quite the contrary: it was Pasquale
de Luca's <i>I Liberatori</i> (<i>Makers of Freedom</i>, Bergamo,
1909), written to arouse a feeling of patriotism among
the Italian emigrants of Argentina. The special feature
of this publication is its contemporary documents reprinted
in <i>fac-simile</i>. There are, for instance, telegrams, notices in
cipher published on the walls of the towns on the eve of uprisings,
commemorative medals, a receipt given by an executioner
for whipping publicly an Italian patriot, etc.
Patriotic songs are given with the music (these the children
learned by heart, following the piano); there are also
copious illustrations.</p>

<p>This documented history was so absorbing that the
children became entirely possessed by the situations.
They started animated discussions on various subjects,
arguing and deciding. They were particularly outraged
at an edict of the king of Naples which was intended to
mislead the public. They raged at unjust persecutions,
applauded heroic deeds, and ended by insisting on acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
out some of the scenes. They formed little companies of
three or four and "acted" the episodes with a most impressive
dramatic sense. One little girl was moved to bring to
school a collection of all the Italian patriotic songs. It
fascinated many of the children, who learned several by
heart and sang them in chorus. In a word, the Italian
Risorgimento came to live in those little hearts with a freshness
it has long since lost in the souls of their elders.
Many of the children wrote down their impressions of their
own accord, often giving surprisingly original judgments.
Finally they began to "take notes." They asked the
teacher to give an outline of the principal events, which
they took down in their copy-books. This whole experience
corrected many of my own ideas on the teaching of
history. I had thought of preparing moving-picture films
and giving historical representations. But that, naturally,
being beyond my resources, I had been compelled to give
up the plan. The reading of De Luca's book was a revelation.
To teach history to children it is sufficient to give
a <i>living documented truth</i>. We need, not more cinematographs,
but different school books. Children are much
more sensible to the true and beautiful than we. They
suggest fact and situation. De Luca, moved by affection
for his distant brothers, tried to write a book flaming both
with truth and with love, which would awaken them and
bring them back to live among us as Italians. Our task
is the same. We must be filled with a similarly intense
human zeal: we must call back to us the distant souls of
the children. They too are brothers living far away in
a distant country. We must arouse them, bring them
back to us as partners in our own life.</p>

<p>After our readings from Itard's <i>Savage</i>, the parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the children kept coming to us with inquiries:
"What have you been reading to our children? We
should like to hear it ourselves." The little ones had told
of hearing an extraordinary story about a child who had
lived with the animals, beginning little by little to understand,
to feel, to live like us. All the psychological details
of his study, his attempts at education, seemed to have
touched the children deeply. It occurred to us to take the
older of such children to a "Children's House" and show
them our educational method. They took the greatest interest
in it, and some of them are now collaborators in the
foundation of other "Children's Houses." Such children
are able to follow the development of the child mind with
extraordinary sympathy. However, if we reflect that the
best teachers for children are children themselves, and that
little tots like the company of another child much better
than that of an adult, we need not be surprised at the downfall
of another prejudice.</p>

</div>

<p>We have conceived of children according to a fantastic
idea of our own, making of them a sort of human species
distinct from that to which adults belong. As a matter
of fact, they are our children, more purely human than
we ourselves. The beautiful and the true have for them
an intense fascination, into which they plunge as into
something actually necessary for their existence.</p>

<p>The results here witnessed led us to many a reflection.
We succeeded in teaching history and even pedagogy by
means of "reading." And, in truth, does not reading
embrace everything? Travel stories teach geography;
insect stories lead the child into natural science; and so
on. The teacher, in short, can use reading to introduce
her pupils to the most varied subjects; and the moment
they have been thus started, they can go on to any limit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
guided by the single passion for reading. Our task is to
offer the child the instruments of education, to keep pure
within him the springs of his intellectual growth, of his
life of feeling. The rest follows as a matter of course.
As the ancients said: "<i>Necessary</i> education is the three
'r's': reading, writing and arithmetic," for these are
things which the child cannot discover by himself. We
can only add that "method" must be scientifically determined
only at the points where it becomes necessary to
assist the "formation of man," that he may develop his
activities by strengthening them and not by repressing
them, that he may receive essential help without losing any
pure freshness of his interior activities. But this
does not mean that "a rigorous method must guide the
child at all times and in every step that he takes." When
he has become strong and is in possession of his tools for
discovery, he will be able to uncover many of life's secrets
by himself. We tied the child to the materials in his sensory
exercises, but we left him free to explore his environment.
This must be the method for all his later steps in
advance: he must be given the instrument and the strength
to use it, and then left free to find things out for himself.</p>

<p>The fondness of children for reading and their preference
for the "true" is something already demonstrated
by experiments conducted elsewhere. I may refer here to
the investigations on readings for children conducted by
the "Education" section of the Federation for School
Libraries of the province of Emilia (Italy). The questionnaire
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you remember what books you have read and which you
liked best?</p>

<p>How did you get them?</p>

<p>Do you know the title of some book you would like to read?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you prefer fairy-tales, or rather stories of true or probable
facts? Why?</p>

<p>Do you prefer sad or humorous stories?</p>

<p>Do you like poetry?</p>

<p>Do you like stories of travel and adventure?</p>

<p>Do you subscribe to any weekly or monthly newspaper? If
so, to which?</p>

<p>If your mother were to offer you a choice between a subscription
to a weekly or monthly and an illustrated
book, which would you take? And why?</p></blockquote>

<p>The answers, very carefully sifted, showed that the vast
majority of children preferred readings which dealt with
fact. Here are some of the reasons alleged by the children
in support for their preference for "truth": "Facts
teach me something; fairy-tales are too improbable; true
stories don't upset my thinking; true stories teach me history;
true stories always convey some good idea; fairy-stories
give me desires impossible to satisfy; many
good ideas come from actual experiences; fantastic tales
make me think too much about supernatural things"; etc.,
etc. In favor of the fairy-tales we find: "They amuse
me in hours free from work; I like to be in the midst of
fairies and enchantments"; etc. Those who preferred
sad or serious stories justified themselves as follows: "I
feel that I am a better person, and realize better the wrong
I do; I feel that my disposition becomes more kindly; they
arouse in me feelings of kindness and pity." Many supported
their preference for humorous tales on the ground
that "when I read them, I am able to forget my own little
troubles." In general, a great majority denied any
educational value to joy and humor. In this conviction&mdash;or
rather this feeling&mdash;so widely diffused among children,
have we not evidence that something must be wrong
in the kind of education we have been giving them?</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ARITHMETICAL OPERATIONS</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Numbers</span>: 1-10</h3>


<p>The children already had performed the four arithmetical
operations in their simplest forms, in the "Children's
Houses," the didactic material for these having consisted
of the rods of the long stair which gave empirical
representation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
By means of its divisions into sections of alternating
colors, red and blue, each rod represented the quantity of
unity for which it stood; and so the entrance into the
complex and arduous field of numbers was thus rendered
easy, interesting, and attractive by the conception that collective
number can be represented by a <i>single</i> object containing
signs by which the relative quantity of unity can
be recognized, instead of by <i>a number of different</i> units,
represented by the figure in question. For instance, the
fact that five may be represented by a single object with
five distinct and equal parts instead of by five distinct objects
which the mind must reduce to a concept of number,
saves mental effort and clarifies the idea.</p>

<p>It was through the application of this principle by
means of the rods that the children succeeded so easily in
accomplishing the first arithmetical operations: 7 + 3 =
10; 2 + 8 = 10; 10 - 4 = 6; etc.</p>

<p>The long stair material is excellent for this purpose.
But it is too limited in quantity and is too large to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
handled easily and used to good advantage in meeting the
demands of a room full of children who already have been
initiated into arithmetic. Therefore, keeping to the same
fundamental concepts, we have prepared smaller, more
abundant material, and one more readily accessible to a
large number of children working at the same time.</p>

<p>This material consists of beads strung on wires: i.e.,
bead bars representing respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10. The beads are of different colors. The 10-bead bar
is orange; 9, dark blue; 8, lavender; 7, white; 6, gray;
5, light blue; 4, yellow; 3, pink; 2, green; and there are
separate beads for unity.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The beads are opalescent; and
the white metal wire on which they are strung is bent
at each end, holding the beads rigid and preventing them
from slipping.</p>

<p>There are five sets of these attractive objects in each
box; and so each child has at his disposal the equivalent
of five sets of the long stairs used for his numerical combinations
in the earliest exercise. The fact that the rods
are small and so easily handled permits of their being used
at the small tables.</p>

<p>This very simple and easily prepared material has been
extraordinarily successful with children of five and a
half years. They have worked with marked concentration,
doing as many as sixty successive operations and filling
whole copybooks within a few days' time. Special
quadrille paper is used for the purpose; and the sheets are
ruled in different colors: some in black, some in red, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in green, some in blue, some in pink, and some in orange.
The variety of colors helps to hold the child's attention:
after filling a sheet lined in red, he will enjoy filling one
lined in blue, etc.</p>

<p>Experience has taught us to prepare a large number of
the ten-bead bars; for the children will choose these from
all the others, in order to count the tens in succession:
10, 20, 30, 40, etc. To this first bead material, therefore,
we have added boxes filled with nothing but ten-bead
bars. There are also small cards on which are written
10, 20, etc. The children put together two or more of
the ten-bead bars to correspond with the number on the
cards. This is an initial exercise which leads up to the
multiples of 10. By superimposing these cards on that for
the number 100 and that for the number 1000, such numbers
as <i>1917</i> can be obtained.</p>

<p>The "bead work" became at once an established element
in our method, scientifically determined as a conquest
brought to maturity by the child in the very act of
making it. Our success in amplifying and making more
complex the early exercises with the rods has made the
child's mental calculation more rapid, more certain, and
more comprehensive. Mental calculation develops spontaneously,
as if by a law of conservation tending to realize
the "minimum of effort." Indeed, little by little the
child ceases counting the beads and recognizes the numbers
by their color: the dark blue he knows is 9, the
yellow 4, etc. Almost without realizing it he comes now
to count by <i>colors</i> instead of by <i>quantities</i> of beads, and
thus performs actual operations in mental arithmetic. As
soon as the child becomes conscious of this power, he joyfully
announces his transition to the higher plane, exclaiming,
"I can count in my head and I can do it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
quickly!" This declaration indicates that he has conquered
the first bead material.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tens, Hundreds, and Thousands</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> I have had a chain made by joining ten
ten-bead bars end to end. This is called the "hundred
chain." Then, by means of short and very flexible connecting
links I had ten of these "hundred chains" put
together, making the "thousand chain."</p>

<p>These chains are of the same color as the ten-bead bars,
all of them being constructed of orange-colored beads.
The difference in their reciprocal length is very striking.
Let us first put down a single bead; then a ten-bead bar,
which is about seven centimeters long; then a hundred-bead
chain, which is about seventy centimeters long; and
finally the thousand-bead chain, which is about seven
meters long. The great length of this thousand-bead
chain leads directly to another idea of quantity; for
whereas the 1, the 10, and the 100 can be placed on the
table for convenient study, the entire length of the room
will hardly suffice for the thousand-bead chain! The children
find it necessary to go into the corridor or an adjoining
room; they have to form little groups to accomplish
the patient work of stretching it out into a straight line.
And to examine the whole extent of this chain, they have
to walk up and down its entire length. The realization
they thus obtain of the relative values of quantity is in
truth an event for them. For days at a time this amazing
"thousand chain" claims the child's entire activity.</p>

<p>The flexible connections between the different hundred
lengths of the thousand-bead chain permit of its being
folded so that the "hundred chains" lie one next to the
other, forming in their entirety a long rectangle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
same quantity which formerly impressed the child by its
length is now, in its broad, folded form, presented as a
<i>surface</i> quantity.</p>

<p>Now all may be placed on a small table, one below the
other: first the single bead, then the ten-bead bar, then
the "hundred chain," and finally the broad strip of the
"thousand chain."</p>

<p>Any teacher who has asked herself how in the world a
child may be taught to express in numerical terms quantitative
proportions perceived through the eye, has some
idea of the problem that confronts us. However, our children
set to work patiently counting bead by bead from
1 to 100. Then they gathered in two's and three's about
the "thousand chain," as if to help one another in counting
it, undaunted by the arduous undertaking. They
counted on hundred; and after one hundred, what? One
hundred one. And finally two hundred, two hundred one.
One day they reached seven hundred. "I am tired,"
said the child. "I'll mark this place and come back tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Seven hundred, seven hundred&mdash;Look!" cried another
child. "There are seven&mdash;<i>seven</i> hundreds! Yes,
yes; count the chains! Seven hundred, eight hundred,
nine hundred, one thousand. Signora, signora, the
'thousand chain' has ten 'hundred chains'! Look at
it!" And other children, who had been working with
the "hundred chain," in turn called the attention of <i>their</i>
comrades: "Oh, look, look! The 'hundred chain' has
ten ten-bead bars!"</p>

<p>Thus we realized that the numerical concept of tens,
hundreds, and thousands was given by presenting these
chains to the child's intelligent curiosity and by respecting
the spontaneous endeavors of his free activities.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>And since this was our experience with most of the
children, one easily can see how simple a suggestion would
be necessary if the deduction did not take place in the case
of some exceptional child. In fact, to make the idea of
decimal relations apparent to a child, it is sufficient to direct
his attention to the material he is handling. The
teacher experienced in this method knows how to wait; she
realizes that the child needs to exercise his mind constantly
and slowly; and if the inner maturation takes
place naturally, "intuitive explosions" are bound to follow
as a matter of course. The more we allow the children
to follow the interests which have claimed their fixed
attention, the greater will be the value of the results.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Counting-Frames</span></h3>

<p>The direct assistance of the teacher, her clear and brief
explanation, is, however, essential when she presents to
the child another new material, which may be considered
"symbolic" of the decimal relations. This material consists
of two very simple bead counting-frames, similar in
size and shape to the dressing-frames of the first material.
They are light and easily handled and may be included in
the individual possessions of each child. The frames are
easily made and are inexpensive.</p>

<p>One frame is arranged with the longest side as base,
and has four parallel metal wires, each of which is strung
with ten beads. The three top wires are equidistant but
the fourth is separated from the others by a greater distance,
and this separation is further emphasized by a brass
nail-head fixed on the left hand side of the frame. The
frame is painted one color above the nail-head and another
color below it; and on this side of the frame, also,
numerals corresponding to each wire are marked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
numeral opposite the top wire is 1, the next 10, then 100,
and the lowest, 1000.</p>

<p>We explain to the child that each bead of the first wire
is assumed to stand for one, or unity, as did the separate
beads they have had before; but each bead of the second
wire stands for ten (or for one of the ten-bead bars); the
value of each bead of the third wire is one hundred and
represents the "hundred chain"; and each bead on the
last wire (which is separated from the others by the brass
nail-head) has the same value as a "thousand chain."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>At first it is not easy for the child to understand this
symbolism, but it will be less difficult if he previously has
worked over the chains, counting and studying them without
being hurried. When the concept of the relationship
between unity, tens, hundreds, and thousands has matured
spontaneously, he more readily will be able to recognize
and use the symbol.</p>

<p>Specially lined paper is designed for use with these
frames. This paper is divided lengthwise into two equal
parts, and on both sides of the division are vertical lines
of different colors: to the right a green line, then a blue,
and next a red line. These are parallel and equidistant.
A vertical line of dots separates this group of three lines
from another line which follows. On the first three lines
from right to left are written respectively the units, tens,
and hundreds; on the inner line the thousands.</p>

<p>The right half of the page is used entirely and exclusively
to clarify this idea and to show the relationship of
written numbers to the decimal symbolism of the counting-frame.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>With this object in view, we first count the beads on
each wire of the frame; saying for the top wire, one unit,
two units, three units, four units, five units, six units,
seven units, eight units, nine units, ten units. The ten
units of this top wire are equal to one bead on the second
wire.</p>

<p>The beads on the second wire are counted in the same
way: one ten, two tens, three tens, four tens, five tens, six
tens, seven tens, eight tens, nine tens, ten tens. The ten
ten-beads are equal to one bead on the third wire.</p>

<p>The beads on this third wire then are counted one by
one: one hundred, two hundreds, three hundreds, four hundreds,
five hundreds, six hundreds, seven hundreds, eight
hundreds, nine hundreds, ten hundreds. These ten hundred-beads
are equal to one of the thousand-beads.</p>

<p>There also are ten thousand-beads: one thousand, two
thousands, three thousands, four thousands, five thousands,
six thousands, seven thousands, eight thousands, nine thousands,
ten thousands. The child can picture ten separate
"thousand chains"; this symbol is in direct relation,
therefore, to a tangible idea of quantity.</p>

<p>Now we must transcribe all these acts by which we have
in succession counted, ten units, ten tens, ten hundreds,
and ten thousands. On the first vertical line to the extreme
right (the green line) we write the units, one beneath
the other; on the second line (blue) we write the
tens; on the third line (red) the hundreds; and, finally,
on the line beyond the dots we write the thousands. There
are sufficient horizontal lines for all the numbers, including
one thousand.</p>

<p>Having reached 9, we must leave the line of the units
and pass over to that of the tens; in fact, ten units make
one ten. And, similarly, when we have written 9 in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
tens line we must of necessity pass to the hundreds line,
because ten tens equal one hundred. Finally, when 9 in
the hundreds line has been written, we must pass to the
thousands line for the same reason.</p>

<p>The units from 1 to 9 are written on the line farthest
to the right; on the next line to the left are written the
tens (from 1 to 9); and on the third line, the hundreds
(from 1 to 9). Thus always we have the numbers 1 to 9;
and it cannot be otherwise, for any more would cause the
figure itself to change position. It is this fact that the
child must quietly ponder over and allow to ripen in his
mind.</p>

<p>It is the nine numbers that change position in order to
form all the numbers that are possible. Therefore, it is
not the number in itself but its <i>position</i> in respect to the
other numbers which gives it the value now of one, now of
ten, now of one hundred or one thousand. Thus we have
the symbolic translation of those real values which increase
in so prodigious a way and which are almost impossible
for us to conceive. One line of ten thousand beads is
seventy meters long! Ten such lines would be the length
of a long street! Therefore we are forced to have recourse
to symbols. How very important this <i>position</i> occupied
by the number becomes!</p>

<p>How do we indicate the position and hence the value
of a certain number with reference to other numbers?
As there are not always vertical lines to indicate the relative
position of the figure, <i>the requisite number of zeros
are placed to the right of the figure!</i></p>

<p>The children already know, from the "Children's
House," that zero has no value and that it can give no
value to the figure with which it is used. It serves merely
to show the position and the value of the figure written at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
its left. Zero does not give value to 1 and so make it become
10: the zero of the number 10 indicates that the
figure 1 is not a unit but is in the next preceding position&mdash;that
of the tens&mdash;and means therefore one ten and not
one unit. If, for instance, 4 units followed the 1 in the
tens position, then the figure 4 would be in the units place
and the 1 would be in the tens position.</p>

</div>

<p>The "Children's House" child already knows how to
write ten and even one hundred; and it is now very easy
for him to write, with the aid of zeros, and <i>in columns</i>,
from 1 to 1000: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90; 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700,
800, 900; 1,000. When the child has learned to count
well in this manner, he can easily read any number of
four figures.</p>

<p>Let us now make up a number on the counting-frame;
for example, 4827. We move four beads to the left on
the thousands-wire, eight on the hundreds-wire, two on
the tens-wire, and seven on the units-wire; and we read,
four thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven. This
number is written by placing the numbers <i>on the same
line</i> and in the mutually relative order determined by the
symbolic positions for the decimal relations, 4827.</p>

<p>We can do the same with the date of our present year,
writing the figures on the left-hand side of the paper as indicated:
1917.</p>

<p>Let us compose 2049 on the symbolic number frame.
Two of the thousand-beads are moved to the left, four of
the ten-beads, and nine of the unit-beads. On the hundreds-wire
there is nothing. Here we have a good demonstration
of the function of zero, which is to occupy the
places that are empty on this chart.</p>

<p>Similarly, to form the number 4700 on the frame, four
thousand-beads are moved to the left and seven hundred-beads,
the tens-wire and the units-wire remaining empty.
In transcribing this number, these empty places are filled
by zeros&mdash;a figure of no value in itself.</p>

<span class="caption">This shows the first bead frame which the child uses in his study of arithmetic.

</div>

<p>When the child fully understands this process he makes
up many exercises of his own accord and with the greatest
interest. He moves beads to the left at random, on one
or on all of the wires, then interprets and writes the number
on the sheets of paper purposely prepared for this.
When he has comprehended the position of the figures and
performed operations with numbers of several figures he
has mastered the process. The child need only be left to
his auto-exercises here in order to attain perfection.</p>

<p>Very soon he will ask to go beyond the thousands. For
this there is another frame, with seven wires representing
respectively units, tens, and hundreds; units, tens and
hundreds of the thousands; and a million.</p>

<p>This frame is the same size as the other one but in this
the shorter side is used as the base and there are seven
wires instead of four. The right-hand side is marked by
three different colors according to the groups of wires.
The units, tens, and hundreds wires are separated from
the three thousands wires by a brass tack, and these in
turn are separated in the same manner from the million
wire.</p>

<p>The transition from one frame to the other furnishes
much interest but no difficulty. Children will need very
few explanations and will try by themselves to understand
as much as possible. The large numbers are the
most interesting to them, therefore the easiest. Soon their
copybooks are full of the most marvelous numbers; they
have now become dealers in millions.</p>

<p>For this frame also there is specially prepared paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a><br /><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
On the right-hand side the child writes the numbers corresponding
to the frame, counting from one to a million:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90;
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900; 1,000,
2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000;
10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, 70,000,
80,000, 90,000; 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000,
600,000, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000; 1,000,000.</p>

<p>After this the child, moving the beads to the left on one
or more of the wires, tries to read and then to write on the
left half of the paper the numbers resulting from these haphazard
experiments. For example, on the counting-frame
he may have the number 6,206,818, and on the paper the
numbers 1,111,111; 8,640,850; 1,500,000; 3,780,000;
5,840,714; 720,000; 500,000; 430,000; 35,840; 80,724;
15,229; 1,240.</p>

<p>When we come to add and subtract numbers of several
figures and to write the results in column, the facility resulting
from this preparation is something astonishing.</p>
<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> At the present time, because of the difficulty of getting beads of
certain colors, owing to war conditions, the following colors have been
approved by Dr. Montessori to replace those originally used: 10 bead
bar, gold; 9, dark blue; 8, white; 7, light green; 6, light blue; 5, yellow;
4, pink; 3, green; 2, yellow-green; 1, gold. These same colors
are retained for the bead squares and the bead cubes. They will be
supplied by The House of Childhood, 16 Horatio Street, New York.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It would, perhaps, be better in this first counting-frame to have
the beads not only of different colors, but of different sizes, according
to the value of the wires, as was suggested to me by a Portuguese
professor who had been taking my course.</p></div></div>

<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> The material for the multiplication table
is in several parts. There is a square cardboard with a
hundred sockets or indentures (ten rows, ten in a row),
and into each of these indentures may be placed a bead.
At the top of the square and corresponding to each vertical
line of indentures are printed the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. At the left is an opening into which
may be slipped a small piece of cardboard upon which are
printed in red the numbers from 1 to 10. This cardboard
serves as the multiplicand; and it can be changed,
for there are ten of these slips, bearing the ten different
numbers. In the upper left-hand corner is a small indenture
for a little red marker, but this detail is merely
secondary. This arithmetic board is a white square with
a red border; and with it comes an attractive box containing
a hundred loose beads.</p>

<p>The exercise which is done with this material is very
simple. Suppose that 6 is to be multiplied by the numbers
in turn from 1 to 10: 6 × 1; 6 × 2; 6 × 3; 6 × 4;
6 × 5; 6 × 6; 6 × 7; 6 × 8; 6 × 9; 6 × 10. Opposite
the sixth horizontal line of indentures, in the small
opening at the left is slipped the card bearing the number
6. In multiplying the 6 by 1, the child performs two
operations: first, he puts the red marker above the printed
1 at the top of the board, and then he puts six beads (corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to the number 6) in a vertical column underneath
the number 1. To multiply 6 by 2, he places the red
marker over the printed 2, and adds six more beads, placed
in a column under number 2. Similarly, multiplying 6
by 3, the red marker must be placed over the 3, and six
more beads added in a vertical line under that number.
In this manner he proceeds up to 6 × 10.</p>

<p>The shifting of the little red marker serves to indicate
the multiplier and requires constant attention on the part
of the child and great exactness in his work.</p>

<div class='center'>3</div>

</tr>

</table></div>

<p>While the child is doing these operations he is writing
down the results. For this purpose there is specially prepared
paper with an attractive heading which the child can
place at the right of his multiplication board. There are
ten sets of this paper in a series and ten series in a set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
making a hundred sheets with each set of multiplication
material. The accompanying cut shows a sheet prepared
for the multiplication of number 3.</p>

<p>Everything is ready on the printed sheet; the child has
only to write the results which he obtains by adding the
beads in columns of three each. If he makes no error
he will write: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.</p>

<p>In this way he will work out and write down the whole
series from 1 to 10; and as there are ten copies of each
sheet, he can repeat each exercise ten times.</p>

<p>Thus the child learns by memory each of these multiplications.
And we find that he helps himself to memorize
even in other ways. He walks up and down holding
the multiplication sheet, which he looks at from time
to time. It is a sheet which he himself has filled, and
he may be memorizing seven times six, forty-two; seven
times seven, forty-nine; seven times eight, fifty-six, etc.</p>

<p>This material for the multiplication table is one of
the most interesting to the children. They fill six or
seven sets, one after the other, and work for days and
weeks on this one exercise. Almost all of them ask to
take it home with them. With us, the first time the material
was presented a small uprising took place, for they
all wished to carry it away with them. As this was not
permitted the children implored their mothers to buy it
for them, and it was with difficulty that we made them
understand that it was not on the market and therefore
could not be purchased. But the children could not
give up the idea. One older girl headed the rebellion.
"The Dottoressa wants to try an experiment with us,"
she said. "Well, let's tell her that unless she gives us
the material for the multiplication table we won't come
to school any more."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>This threat in itself was impolite, and yet it was interesting;
for the multiplication table, the bug-bear of all
children, had become so attractive and tempting a thing
that it had made wolves out of my lambs!</p>

<p>When the children have repeatedly filled a whole series
of these blanks, with the aid of the material, they are
given a test-card by means of which they may compare
their work for verification, and see whether they have
made any errors in their multiplication. Table by table,
number by number, they do the work of comparing each
result with the number which corresponds to it in each
one of the ten columns. When this has been done carefully,
the children possess their own series, the accuracy
of which they are able to guarantee themselves.</p>

<p>The child has built up his multiplication table by a
long series of processes each incomplete in itself. It
will now be easy to teach him to read it as a "multiplication
table," for he already knows it by memory. Indeed,
he will be able to fill the blanks from memory, the
only difficulty being the recognition of the square in which
he must write the number, which must correspond both
to the multiplicand and to the multiplier.</p>

<p>We offer ten of these blank forms in our material.
When the child, left free to work as long as he wishes on
these exercises, has finished them all, he has certainly
learned the multiplication table.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> The same material may be used for division,

<p>Take any number of beads from the box and count

<p>Then taking the box of beads and the arithmetic board
with the hundred indentures we proceed to the operation.</p>

<p>Let us first divide 27 by 10. We place ten beads in
a vertical line under the 1; then in the next row ten
more beads under the 2. The beads, however, are not
sufficient to fill the row under the 3. Now on the paper
prepared for division we write 2 on a line with the 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to the left of the vertical line, and to the right of the
same vertical line we write the remainder 7.</p>

<p>To divide 27 by 9, nine beads are counted out in the
first row, then nine in the second row under the 2, and
still another nine under the 3. There are no beads left
over. So the figure 3 is written after the equal-sign (=)
on a line with 9.</p>

<p>To divide 27 by 8 we count out eight beads, place them
in a row under the 1, and then fill like rows under the 2
and the 3; in the fourth row there are only three beads.
They are the remainder. And so on.</p>

<p>A package of one hundred division blanks comes in
an attractive dark green cover tied with a silk ribbon.
The multiplication blanks, with their tables for comparison

<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL FIGURES</div>


<p>By this time the child can easily perform operations
with numbers of two or more figures, for he possesses all
the materials necessary and is already prepared to make
use of them.</p>

<p>For this work we have for the first three operations,
addition, subtraction, and multiplication, a counting-frame;
and for division a more complicated material which
will be described later on.</p>


<h3>ADDITION</h3>

<p>Addition on the counting frame is a most simple operation,
and therefore is very attractive. Let us take, for
example, the following:</p>

<div class='math'>
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">1320 +</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><span class='u'>&nbsp;435</span></span><br />
=<br />
</div>

<p>First we slide over the beads to represent the first number:
1 on the thousands-wire, 3 on the hundreds-wire,
and 2 on the tens-wire. Then we place next to them
the beads representing the second number: 4 on the hundreds-wire,
3 on the tens-wire, and 5 on the units-wire.
Now there remains nothing to be done except to write the
number shown by the beads in their present position:
1755.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/fp_226.jpg" width="395" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">This shows the second counting-frame used in arithmetic. The child is
writing the number she has just formed on her frame. (<i>The Rivington
Street Montessori School, New York.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>When the problem is a more complicated one, the beads
for any one wire amounting to more than 10, the solution
is still very easy. In that case the entire ten beads
would be returned to their original position and in their
stead one corresponding bead of the next lower wire
would be slipped over. Then the operation is continued.
Take, for example:</p>

<div class='math'>
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">390 +</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><span class='u'>482</span></span><br />
=<br />
</div>

<p>We first place the beads representing 390: that is, 3
on the hundreds-wire and 9 on the tens-wire; or, vice
versa, beginning with the units, we would first place the
9 tens and then the 3 hundreds. For the second number
we place 4 beads for the hundreds and then we begin
to place the 8 tens. But when we have placed only one
ten, the wire is full; so the ten tens are returned to their
original position and to represent them we move over another
bead on the hundreds-wire; then we continue to
place the beads of the tens which now, after having converted
10 of them into 1 hundred, remain but 7. Or
we can begin the addition by placing the beads for the
units before we place those for the hundreds; and in that
case we move on the hundreds-wire first the bead representing
the ten beads on the wire above, and then the
4 hundreds which must be added. Finally we write down
the sum as now indicated by the position of the beads:
872.</p>

<p>With a larger counting-frame it is possible to perform
in this manner very complicated problems in addition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fp_227.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">The two little girls are working out problems in seven figures. (<i>The Washington Montessori School, Washington,
D. C.</i>)</span>
</div>


<h3>SUBTRACTION</h3>

<p>The counting-frame lends itself equally well to problems
in subtraction. Let us take, for example, the following:</p>

<div class='math'>
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">8947-</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><span class='u'>6735</span></span><br />
=<br />
</div>

<p>We place the beads representing the first number; then
from them we take the beads representing the second number
The beads remaining indicate the difference between
the two numbers; and this is written: 2212.</p>

<p>Then comes the more complicated problem where it
is necessary to borrow from a higher denomination.
When the beads of one wire are exhausted, we move over
the entire ten and take to represent them one bead from
the lower wire; then we continue the subtraction. For
example:</p>

<div class='math'>
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">8954-</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"><span class='u'>7593</span></span><br />
=<br />
</div>

<p>We move the beads representing the first number; then
we take 3 beads from the units. Now we begin to subtract
the tens. We wish to take away 9 beads; but when
we have moved five the wire is empty, and there are still
four more to be moved. We take away one bead from
the hundreds-wire and replace the entire ten on the tens-wire;
and then we continue to move beads on the tens-wire
until we have taken a total of nine&mdash;that is, we
now move the other four. On the hundreds-wire there
remain but 8 beads, and from them we take the 5, etc.
Our final remainder is 1361.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a><br /><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to see how familiar and clear to the child
the technique of "borrowing" becomes.</p>


<h3>MULTIPLICATION</h3>

<p>When there is a number to be multiplied by more than
one figure, the child not only knows the multiplication
table but he easily distinguishes the units from the tens,
hundreds, etc., and he is familiar with their reciprocal
relations. He knows all the numbers up to a million and
also their positions in relation to their value. He knows
from habitual practise that a unit of a higher order can be
exchanged for ten of a lower order.</p>

<p>To have the child attack this new difficulty successfully
one need only tell him that each figure of the multiplier
must multiply in turn each figure of the multiplicand
and that the separate products are placed in columns and
then added. The analytical processes hold the child's attention
for a long period of time; and for this reason they
have too great a formative value not to be made use of
in the highest degree. They are the processes which lead
to that inner maturation which gives a deeper realization
of cognitions and which results in bursts of spontaneous
synthesis and abstraction.</p>

<p>The children, by rapidly graduated exercises, soon become
accustomed to writing the analysis of each multiplication
(according to its factors) in such a way that,
once the work of arranging the material is finished, nothing
is left for them to do but to perform the multiplications
which they already have learned in the simple
multiplication table.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the analysis of a multiplication
with three figures appearing in both the multiplicand and
the multiplier: 356 × 742.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="math">
<tr>
<td align="left" rowspan='3'>742 =</td>
<td align="left" rowspan='3' class='ctlb'>&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">3 hundreds</td>

</table></div>




<p>Each of the first numbers is combined with the three figures
of the other number in the following manner:</p>



<div class="center">

<td align="left">u. 6</td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<td align="left">35 thousands</td>

<td align="left">h. 3</td>
<td align="left">21 tens of thousands</td>
</tr>

</table></div>




<p>When this analysis is written down, the work on the
counting-frames begins. Here the operations are performed
in the following manner: 2 × 6 units necessitate
the bringing forward of the ten beads on the first wire.
However, even those do not suffice. So they are slid back
and one bead on the second wire is brought forward,
to represent the ten replaced, and on the first wire two
beads are brought forward (12).</p>

<p>Next we take 2 × 5 tens. There is already one bead
on the tens-wire and to this should be added ten more,
but instead we bring forward one bead on the hundreds-wire.
At this point in the operation the beads are distributed
on the wires in this manner:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
1<br />
1<br />
</div>

<p>Now comes 2 × 3 hundreds, and six beads on the corresponding
wire are brought forward. When the multiplication
by the units of the multiplier is finished, the
beads on the frame are in the following order:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
1<br />
7<br />
</div>

<p>We pass now to the tens: 4 × 6 = 24 tens. We must
therefore bring forward four beads on the tens-wire and
two on the hundreds-wire:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br />
9<br />
</div>

<p>4 × 5 = 20 hundreds, therefore two thousands:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br />
9<br />
2<br />
</div>

<p>4 × 3 thousands = 12 thousands; so we bring forward
two beads on the thousands-wire and one on the ten-thousands-wire:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br />
9<br />
4<br />
1<br />
</div>

<p>Now we take the hundreds: 7 × 6 hundreds are 42
hundreds; therefore we slide four beads on the thousands-wire
and two on the hundreds-wire. But there already
were nine beads on this wire, so only one remains and
the other ten give us instead another bead on the thousands-wire:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
1<br />
9<br />
1<br />
</div>

<p>5 × 7 thousands = 35 thousands, which is the same as
five thousands and three ten-thousands. Three beads on
the fifth wire and five on the fourth are brought forward;
but on the fourth wire there already were nine beads, so
we leave only four, exchanging the other ten for one bead
on the fifth wire:</p>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br />
1<br />
4<br />
5<br />
</div>

<p>Finally 7 × 3 ten-thousands = 21 ten-thousands. One
bead is brought forward on the fifth wire and two on the
hundred-thousands-wire.</p>

<p>At the end of the operation the beads will be distributed
as follows:</p>



<div class="center">

<p>This distribution translated into figures gives the following
number: 264,152. This may be written as a result
right after the factors without the partial products: that
is, 742 × 356 = 264,152.</p>

<p>Although this description may sound very complicated,
the exercise on the counting-frame is an easy and most interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
arithmetic game. And this game, which contains
the secret of such surprising results, not only is an
exercise which makes more and more clear the decimal relations
of reciprocal value and position, but also it explains
the manner of procedure in abstract operations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="272" height="347" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1. The disposition of the beads for the number 49,152.</span>
</div>

<p>In fact, in the multiplication as commonly performed:</p>

<div class='math'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;356 ×<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='u'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;742</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;712<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1424&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<span class='u'>2492&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
264152<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>the same operations are involved; but the figures, once
written down, cannot be modified as is possible on the
frame by moving the beads and substituting beads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
higher value for those of lower value when the ten beads
of one wire, as a mechanical result of the structure of
the frame, are all used. As multiplication is ordinarily
written, such substitutions cannot be made; but the partial
products must be written down in order, placed in
column according to their value, and finally added. This
is a much longer piece of work, because the act of writing
a figure is more complicated than that of moving a
bead which slides easily on the metal wire. Again, it is
not so clear as the work with the beads, once the child
is accustomed to handling the frame and no longer has
any doubt as to the position of the different values, and
when it has become a sort of routine to substitute one
bead of the lower wire for the ten beads of the upper
wire which have been exhausted. Furthermore, it is much
easier to add new products without the possibility of making
a mistake. Let us go back to the point in the operation
where the beads on the frame read thus:</div>

<div class='center'>
2<br />
5<br />
1<br />
9<br />
1<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and it was necessary to add 35 thousands&mdash;five beads
to the thousands-wire and three beads to the ten-thousands-wire.
The three beads on the fifth wire can be brought
forward without any thought as to what will happen on
the wire above when the five are added to the nine. Indeed,
what takes place there does not make any difference,
for it is not necessary that the operation on the higher
wire precede that on the lower wire.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/i_234.jpg" width="272" height="340" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. The disposition of the beads for the number 54,152; after
adding 5 thousands to the number 49,152.</span>
</div>

<p>In adding the five beads to the nine beads only four
remain on the fourth wire, since the other ten are substituted
by a bead on the lower wire; this bead may be
brought forward even after the three for the ten-thousands
have been placed.</p>

<p>By the use of the frame the child acquires remarkable
dexterity and facility in calculating, and this makes
his work in multiplication much more rapid. Often one
child, working out an example on paper, has finished only
the first partial multiplication when another child, working
at the frame, has completed the problem and knows
the final product. It is interesting even among adults to
watch two compete in the same problem, one at the frame
and the other using the ordinary method on paper.</p>

<p>It is very interesting, also, not to work out on the frame
the individual products in the sequence indicated in analyzing
the factors, but to work them out by chance. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
it does not matter whether the beads are moved in
the order of their alignment or at random. The beads
on the ten-thousands-wire may be moved first, then the
hundreds, the units, and finally the thousands.</p>

<p>These exercises, which give such a deep understanding
of the operations of arithmetic, would be impossible
with the abstract operation which is performed only by
means of figures. And it is evident that the exercises
can be amplified to any extent as a pleasing game.</p>


<h3>MULTIPLYING ON RULED PAPER</h3>

<p>Take, for example, 8640 × 2531. We write the figures
of the multiplicand one under the other but in their
relative positions; this also can be written by filling in the
vacant spaces with zeros.</p>

<p>In this way we repeat the multiplicand as many times
as there are figures in the multiplier; but instead of writing
beside these figures the words units, tens, etc., we indicate
this with zeros, which, for the sake of clearness, we fill
in till they resemble large dots.</p>

<p>The child already knows, from his previous exercises,
that zero indicates the position of a figure and that multiplying
by ten changes this position. Therefore zeros in
the multiplier would cause a corresponding change of position
in the figures of the multiplicand.</p>

<p>The accompanying figure shows clearly what it is not

<p>We are now ready for the usual procedure of multiplication.
A child of seven years reaches this stage very
easily after having done our preliminary exercises, and
then it does not matter to him how many figures he has
to use. Indeed, he is very fond of working with numbers
of unheard of figures, as is shown in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
example&mdash;one of the usual exercises done by the children,
who of themselves choose the multiplicand and the
multiplier; the teacher would never think of giving such
enormous numbers. They can now perform the operation</p>

<p>without analysis of factors and without help from the
frames but by the method commonly used. This may be
seen by the way in which the example is written out and
then done by the child.</p>


<h3>LONG DIVISION</h3>

<p>Not only is it possible to perform long division with our
bead material, but the work is so delightful that it becomes
an arithmetical pastime especially adapted to the
child's home activities. Using the beads clarifies the different
steps of the operation, creating almost a <i>rational
arithmetic</i> which supersedes the common empirical methods,
that reduce the mechanism of abstract operations to
a simple <i>routine</i>. For this reason, these pastimes prepare
the way for the rational processes of mathematics
which the child meets in the higher grades.</p>

<p>The bead frame will no longer suffice here. We need
the square arithmetic board used for the first partial multiplications
and for short division. However, we require
several such boards and an adequate provision of beads.
The work is too complicated to be described clearly, but
in practise it is easy and most interesting.</p>

<p>It is sufficient here to suggest the method of procedure
with the material. The units, tens, hundreds, etc., are
expressed by different-colored beads: <i>units</i>, white; <i>tens</i>,
green; <i>hundreds</i>, red. Then there are racks of different
colors: <i>white</i> for the simple units, tens, and hundreds;
<i>gray</i> for the thousands; <i>black</i> for the millions. There
also are boxes, which on the outside are white, gray, or
black, and on the inside white, green, or red. And for
each box there is a corresponding rack containing ten tubes
with ten beads in each.</p>

<p>Suppose we must divide 87,632 by 64. Five of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
boxes are put in a row, arranged from left to right according
to the value of their color, as follows: two gray boxes&mdash;one
green inside and the other white&mdash;and three white
boxes with the inside respectively red, green, and white.
In the first box to the left we put 8 green beads; in the
second box 7 white beads; in the third, 6 red beads; in
the fourth 3 green beads; and in the fifth box 2 white
beads. Back of each box is one of the racks with ten
tubes filled with beads of corresponding colors. These
beads&mdash;ten in each tube&mdash;are used in exchanging the
units of a higher denomination for those of a lower.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/fp_238.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">The child here is solving a problem in long division. (<i>A Montessori School,
Barcelona, Spain.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>There are two arithmetic boards, one next to the other,
placed below the row of boxes. In the one to the left, the
little cardboard with the figure 6 is inserted in the slot
we have described, and in the other to the right the figure
4.</p>

<p>Now to divide 87,632 by 64, place the first two boxes
at the left (containing 8 and 7 beads respectively) above
the two arithmetic boards. On the first board the eight
beads are arranged in rows of six, as in the more simple
division. On the second board the seven beads are arranged
in rows of four, corresponding to the number indicated
by the red figure. The two quotients must be reduced
with reference to the quotient in the first arithmetic
board. All the other is considered as a remainder. The
quotient in this case is 1 and the remainders are 2 on the
first board and 3 on the second.</p>

<p>When this is finished, the boxes are moved up one place
and then the first box is out of the game, its place having
been taken by the second box; so the gray-green box
is no longer above the first board but the gray-white one
instead, and above the second board we must place the box
with the red beads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/fp_239.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="photographs" />
<span class="caption">The illustration at the top shows the square and the cube of 4 and of 5.
That in the middle shows the arithmetic board being used for multiplication.
In the photograph at the bottom a problem in division
is being worked out on the arithmetic-board: 26 ÷ 4 = 6 and 2 remainder.</span>
</div>

<p>Now the beads must be adjusted. The two beads that
are left over on the card marked with the number 6 are
green but the box above this card is the gray-white one.
We must therefore change the green beads into white
beads, taking for each one of them a tube of ten white
beads. The white beads which were left over on the other
card must be brought to the card above which the white
box is now placed. We have only to arrange the white
beads now in rows of six while the other box of red beads
is emptied on to the second board in rows of four, as in
simple division.</p>

<p>With the material arranged in this way according to
color, we proceed to the reduction, which is done by
exchanging one bead of a higher denomination for
ten of a lower. Thus, for example, in the present case we
have twenty-three white beads distributed on the first
board in rows of six, which gives a quotient of three and
a remainder of five. On the second board there are six
red beads distributed in rows of four, giving a quotient
of one with a remainder of two. Now the work of reduction
begins. This consists in taking one by one the
beads from the board to the left&mdash;in this case the white&mdash;and
exchanging them for ten red beads, which in turn
are placed in rows of four on the other board until the
quotients on the two cards are alike. What is left
over is the remainder. In this case it is necessary to
change only the one white bead so as to have the other
quotient reach three with a remainder of four.</p>

<p>The same process is continued until all the boxes are
used.</p>

<p>The final remainder is the one to be written down with
the quotient.</p>

<p>The exercise requires great patience and exactness, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a><br /><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
it is most interesting and might be called an excellent
game of solitaire for children for home use. There is
no intellectual fatigue but much movement and much intense
attention. The quotients and remainders may be
written on a prepared sheet of paper, so as to be verified
by the teacher.</p>

<p>When the child has performed many of these exercises
he comes spontaneously to try to foresee the result of an
operation without having to make the material exchange
and arrangement of the beads; hence to shorten the mechanical
process. When at length he can "see" the situation
at a glance, he will be able to do the most difficult
division by the ordinary processes without experiencing
any fatigue, or without having been obliged to
endure tiring progressive lessons and humiliating corrections.
Not only will he have learned how to perform
long divisions but he will have become a master of their
mechanism. He will realize each step, in ways that the
children of ordinary secondary schools possibly never
will be able to understand, when through the usual methods
of rational mathematics they approach the incomprehensible
operations which they have performed for several
years without considering the reasons for them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EXERCISES WITH NUMBERS</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Multiples, Prime Numbers, Factoring</span></h3>

<p>When the child, by the aid of all this material, has
had a chance to grasp the fundamental ideas relating to
the four operations and has passed on to the execution
of them in the abstract, he is ready to continue on the
numerical processes which will lead to a more profound
study preparatory to the more complex problems that await
him in the secondary schools.</p>

<p>These studies are, however, a means of helping him to
remember the things he already knows and to enlarge
upon them. They come to him as a pastime, as an agreeable
manner of thinking over either in school or at home
the ideas which he already has gained.</p>

<p>One of the first exercises is that of continuing the
multiplication of each number by the series of 1 to 10
which was begun by the exercises on the multiplication
tables. This should be done in the abstract: that is,
without recourse to the material. Let us, however, set
some limit&mdash;we will stop when each product has reached
100. In order that these series of exercises may each be
in one column the first exercises will stop with 50 and
another can be used for the numbers from 51 to 100.</p>

<p>The two following tables (A and B) are the result.
These are prepared in this manner in our material so that
the child may compare his work with them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>To read over a column of the results of each number is
to learn them by heart, and it impresses upon the child's
memory the series of multiples of each number from 1 to
100.</p>

<p>With these tables a child can perform many interesting
exercises. He has sheets of long narrow paper. On
the left are written the series of numbers from 1 to 50
and from 51 to 100. He compares the numbers on these
sheets with the same numbers in the tables, series by
series, and writes down the different factors which he thus
finds; for example, 6 = 2 × 3; 8 = 2 × 4; 10 = 2 × 5.
Then finding the same number in the second column and
the other columns his result will read, 6 = 2 × 3 =
3 × 2; 18 = 2 × 9 = 3 × 6 = 6 × 3 = 9 × 2.</p>

<p>In this comparison the child will find that some numbers
cannot be resolved into factors and their line is blank.
By this means he gets his first intuition of prime numbers
(Tables C and D).</p>

<p>When the child has filled in this work from 1 to 50 and
from 51 to 100 and has reduced the numbers to factors
and prime numbers he may pass on to some exercises with
the beads.</p>

<p>The children now meditate, using the material, on the
results that they have obtained by comparing these tables.
Let us consider, for example, 6 = 2 × 3 = 3 × 2. The
child takes six beads, and first makes two groups of three
beads and then three groups of two.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 147px;">
<img src="images/i_246a.jpg" width="147" height="24" alt="groups of dots" />
</div>

<p>And so on for each number he chooses. For example:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i_246bc_alt.jpg" width="324" height="60" alt="formulas" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="294" height="60" alt="formulas" />
</div>


<p>The child will try in every way to make other combinations
and he will try also to divide the prime numbers into
factors.</p>

<p>This intelligent and pleasing game makes clear to the
child the "divisibility" of numbers. The work that he
does in getting these factors by multiplication is really a
way of dividing the numbers. For example, he has divided
18 into 2 equal groups, 9 equal groups, 6 equal
groups, and 3 equal groups. Previously he has divided 6
into 2 equal groups and then into 3 equal groups. Therefore
when it is a question of multiplying the two factors
there is no difference in the result whether he multiplies
2 by 3 or 3 by 2; for the inverted order of the factors does
not change the product. But in division the object is to
arrange the number in equal parts and any modification
in this equal distribution of objects changes the character
of the grouping. Each separate combination is a different
way of dividing the number.</p>

<p>The idea of division is made very clear to the child's
mind: 6 ÷ 3 = 2, means that the 6 can be divided into
three groups, each of which has two units or objects; and
6 ÷ 2 = 3, means that the 6 also can be divided into but
two equal groups, each group made up of three units or
objects.</p>

<p>The relations between multiplication and division are
very evident since we started with 6 = 3 × 2; 6 = 2 × 3.
This brings out the fact that multiplication may be used
to prove division; and it prepares the child to understand
the practical steps taken in division. Then some day
when he has to do an example in long division, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
find no difficulty with the mental calculation required to
determine whether the dividend, or a part of it, is divisible
by the divisor. This is not the usual preparation for
division, though memorizing the multiplication table is
indeed used as a preparation for multiplication.</p>

<p>From the above exercises (Table D) others might be derived
involving further analysis of the same numbers.
For example, one of the possible factor groups for the
number 40 is 2 × 20. But 20 = 2 × 10; and 10 =
2 × 5. Bringing together the smaller figures into which
the larger numbers have been broken, we get 40 =
2 × 2 × 2 × 5; in other words 40 = 2<sup>3</sup> × 5.</p>

<p>This is the result for 60:</p>

<div class='center'>
60 = 2 × 30 = 2 × 2 × 15 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2<sup>2</sup> × 3 × 5<br />
</div>

<p>For these two numbers we get accordingly the prime
factors: 2<sup>3</sup> × 5; and 2<sup>2</sup> × 3 × 5. What then have the
two larger numbers, 40 and 60 in common? The 2<sup>2</sup> is
included in the 2<sup>3</sup>; the series therefore may be written:
2<sup>2</sup> × 2 × 5; and 2<sup>2</sup> × 3 × 5. The common element
(the greatest common divisor) is 2<sup>2</sup> × 5 = 20. The
proof consists in dividing 60 and 40 by 20, something
which will not be possible for any number higher than 20.</p>

<p>We have test sheets where the numbers from 1 to 100
are arranged in rows of 10, forming a square. Here the
child's exercise consists in underlining, in different
squares, the multiples of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The
numbers so underlined stand out like a design in such a
way that the child easily can study and compare the tables.
For instance, in the square where he underlines the multiples
of 2 all the even numbers in the vertical columns
are marked; in the multiple of 4 we have the same linear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
grouping&mdash;a vertical line&mdash;but the numbers marked
are alternate numbers; in 6 the same vertical grouping
continues, but one number is marked and two are skipped;
and again in the multiples of 8 the same design is repeated
with the difference that every fourth number is
underlined. On the square marked off for the multiples
of 3 the numbers marked form oblique lines running from
right to left and all the numbers in these oblique lines are
underlined. In the multiples of 6 the design is the same
but only the alternating numbers are underlined. The
6 therefore, partakes of the type of the 2 and of the 3;
and both of these are indeed its factors.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SQUARE AND CUBE OF NUMBERS</div>


<p>Let us take two of the two-bead bars (green) which
were used in counting in the first bead exercises. Here,
however, these form part of another series of beads.
Along with these two bars there is a small chain:
<img src="images/i_251a.jpg" width="65" height="14" alt="dots and dash" />
By joining two like bars, the chains represent 2 × 2.
There is another combination of these same objects&mdash;the
two bars are joined together not in a chain but in the
form of a square:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 26px;">
<img src="images/i_251b.jpg" width="26" height="22" alt="dots" />
</div>

<p>They represent the same thing: that is to say, as numbers
they are 2 × 2; but they differ in position&mdash;one has
the form of a line, the other of a square. It can be seen
from this that if as many bars as there are beads on a
bar are placed side by side they form a square.</p>

<p>In the series in fact we offer squares of 3 × 3 pink
beads; 4 × 4 yellow beads; 5 × 5 pale blue beads;
6 × 6 gray beads; 7 × 7 white beads; 8 × 8 lavender
beads; 9 × 9 dark blue beads; and 10 × 10 orange beads;
thus reproducing the same colors as were used at the beginning
in counting.</p>

<p>For every number there are as many bars as there are
beads for the number, 3 bars for the 3, 4 for the 4, etc.;
in addition there is a chain consisting of an equal number
of bars, 3 × 3; 4 × 4; and, as we have seen, there is a
square containing another equal quantity.</p>

<p>The child not only can count the beads of the chains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and squares, but he can reproduce them by placing the
corresponding single bars either in a horizontal line or
laying them side by side in the shape of a square. The
number repeated as many times as the unit it contains is
really the multiplication of the number by itself.</p>

<p>For example, taking the small square of four the child
can count four beads on each side; multiplying 4 by 4
we have the number of beads in the square, 16. Multiplying
one side by itself (squaring one side) we have the
area of the little square.</p>

<p>This can be continued for 5, 8, 9, etc. The square of
10 has ten beads on each side. Multiplying 10 by 10,
in other words, "squaring" one side we get the entire
number of beads forming the area of the square: 100.</p>

<p>However, it is not the form alone which gives these
results; for if the ten bars which formed the square are
placed end to end in a horizontal line, we get the "hundred
chain." This can be done with each square; the
chain 5 × 5, like the square 5 × 5, contains the same
number of beads, 25. We teach the child to write the
numbers with symbol for the square: 5<sup>2</sup> = 25; 7<sup>2</sup> = 49;
10<sup>2</sup> = 100, etc.</p>

<p>Our material here is manufactured with reference to
the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. It is "offered" to
the child, beginning with the smaller numbers. Given
the material and freedom, the idea will come of itself and
the child will "work" it into his consciousness on them.</p>

<p>In this same period we take up also the cubes of the
numbers, and there is a similar material for this: that is,
the chain of the cube of the number is made up of chains
of the square of that number joined by several links which
permit of its being folded. There are as many squares
for a number as there are units in that number&mdash;four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
squares for number 4, six squares for 6, ten squares for 10&mdash;and
a cube of the beads is formed by placing the necessary
number of squares one on top of the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i_253a.jpg" width="425" height="190" alt="dots" />
</div>

<p>Let us consider the cube of four. There is a chain
formed by four chains each representing the square of
four. They are joined by small links so that the chain
can be rolled up lengthwise. The chain of the cube, when
thus rolled, gives four squares similar to the separate
squares which, when drawn out again, for a straight
line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/i_253b.jpg" width="291" height="34" alt="dots" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;This shows only part of the entire chain for 4<sup>3</sup>.</span>
</div>

<p>The quantity is always the same: four times the square
of four. 4 × 4 × 4 = 4<sup>2</sup> × 4 = 4<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The cube of four comes with the material; but it can
be reproduced by placing four loose squares one on top of
the other. Looking at this cube we see that it has all its
edges of four. Multiplying the area of a square by the
number of units contained in the side gives the volume
of the cube: 4<sup>2</sup> × 4.</p>

<p>In this way the child receives his first intuitions of the
processes necessary for finding a surface and volume.</p>

<p>With this material we should not try to teach a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
deal but should leave the child free to ponder over his
own observations&mdash;observing, experimenting, and meditating
upon the easily handled and attractive material.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>Little by little we shall see the slates and copybooks
filled with exercises of numbers raised to the square or
cube independently of the rich series of objects which
the material itself offers the child. In his exercises with
the square and cube of the numbers he easily will discover
that to multiply by ten it suffices to change the position
of the figures&mdash;that is to say, to add a zero. Multiplying
unity by ten gives 10; ten multiplied by ten is
equal to 100; one hundred multiplied by ten is equal to
1,000, etc.</p>

<p>Before arriving at this point the child will often either
have discovered this fact for himself or have learned it by
observing his companions.</p>

<p>Some of the fundamental ideas acquired only through
laborious lessons by our common school methods are here
learned intuitively, naturally, and spontaneously. An
interesting study which completes that already made with
the "hundred chain" and the "thousand chain" is the
comparison of the respective square chain and cube chain.
Such differing relations showing the increasing length
are most illustrative and make a marked impression upon
the child. Furthermore, they prepare for knowledge that
is to be used later. Some day when the child hears of
"geometric progressions" or "linear squares" he will
understand immediately and clearly.</p>

<p>It is interesting to build a small tower with the bead
cubes. Though it will resemble the pink tower, this tower,
which seems to be built of jewels, gives a profound notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of the relations of quantity. By this time these cubes are
no longer recognized superficially through sensorial impressions,
but their minutest details are known to the
child through the progressively intelligent work which they
have occasioned.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a><br /><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>




<h2>PART IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GEOMETRY</div><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a><br /><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>




<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANE GEOMETRY</div>


<p>The geometric insets used for sensorial exercises in the
"Children's House" made it possible for the child to become
familiar with many figures of plane geometry: the
square, rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle, ellipse, etc.
By means of the third series of corresponding cards, where
the figures are merely outlined, he formed the habit of
recognizing a geometric figure represented merely by a
line. Furthermore, he has used a series of iron insets
reproducing some of the geometric figures which he
previously had learned through the use of wooden geometric
insets. He used these iron insets to draw the outline
of a figure, which he then filled in with parallel
lines by means of colored pencils (an exercise in handling
the instruments of writing).</p>

<p>The geometric material here presented to the elementary
classes supplements that used in the "Children's House."
It is similar to the iron insets; but in this material each
frame is fastened to an iron foundation of exactly the same
size as the frame. Since each piece is complete in itself,
no rack is needed to hold them.</p>

<p>The frame of the inset is green, the foundation is white,
and the inset itself&mdash;the movable portion&mdash;is red.
When the inset is in the frame, the red surface and the
green frame are in the same plane.</p>

<p>This material further differs from the other in that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
inset is composed not of a single piece, as in the first material,
but of many pieces which, when put together on the
white foundation, exactly reproduce the geometric figure
there designated.</p>

<p>The use to which these modified insets may be put is
most varied. The main purpose is to facilitate the child's
auto-education through exercises in geometry and often
through the solution of real problems. The fact of being
able actually to "handle geometric figures," to arrange
them in different ways, and to judge of the relations between
them, commands the child's absorbed attention.
The putting together of the insets, which deal with equivalent
figures, reminds one of the "games of patience"&mdash;picture
puzzles&mdash;which have been invented for children
but which, while amusing them, have no definite educational
aim. Here, however, the child leaves the exercises
with "clear concepts" and not merely with general
"notions" of the principles of geometry, a thing which
is very hard to accomplish by the methods common to the
older schools. The difference between like figures, similar
figures, and equivalent figures, the possibility of reducing
every regular plane figure to an equivalent rectangle,
and finally the solution of the theorem of Pythagoras&mdash;all
these are acquired eagerly and spontaneously
by the child. The same may be said about work in fractions,
which is made most interesting by the exercises with
the circular insets. The real meaning of the word <i>fraction</i>,
operations in fractions, the reduction of common
fractions to decimal fractions&mdash;all of this is mastered and
becomes perfectly clear in the child's mind.</p>

<p>These are formative conquests and at the same time a
dynamic part of the child's intellectual activity. A child
who works spontaneously and for a long period of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
with this material not only strengthens his reasoning
powers and his character but acquires higher and clearer
cognitions, which increase his mental capacity. In
his succeeding spontaneous flights into the abstract he
will show ability for surprising progress. While a high
school child is still wasting his mental effort in trying to
understand the relation between geometrical figures, which
it seems impossible for him to comprehend, our child in
the primary grades is "finding it out for himself" and is
so elated by his discovery that he immediately begins
the search for other geometrical relations. Our children
gallop freely along over a smooth road, urged on by the
inner energy of their growing psychic organism, while
many other children plod on barefooted and in shackles
over stony paths.</p>

<p>Every positive conquest gained through objects with
our method of freedom&mdash;allowing the child to exercise
himself at the time when he is most ready for the exercise
and permitting him to complete this exercise&mdash;results
in spontaneous abstractions. How is it possible to
lead a child to perform abstractions if his mind is not
sufficiently mature and he is without adequate information?
These two points of support are, as it were, the
feet of the psychic man who is traveling toward his highest
mental activities. We shall always see the repetition of
this phenomenon. Every ulterior exercise of inner development,
every ulterior cognition, will lead the child
to new and ever higher flights into the realm of the abstract.
It is well, however, to emphasize this principle:
that the mind, in order to fly, must leave from some point
of contact, just as the aeroplane starts from its hangar,
and that it must have reached a certain degree of maturity,
as is the case with the small bird when it tries its wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and starts on its first flight from the nest where it was
born and gained his strength. An aeroplane of perpetual
flight without a means of replenishing its supplies, and
a bird with only an "instinct of flight" without the
process of development that takes place from the egg to the
first flight, are things that do not exist.</p>

<p>A machine flying perpetually without need of replenishing
the fuel for its propelling energy, and an instinct
without a corresponding organism, are pure fancies. The
same is true of the flight of man's imagination, which
soars through space and creates. Though this is the mind's
"manner of being," its "highest instinct," yet it also
needs to find support in reality, to organize its inner forces
from time to time. The longer a material can claim and
hold a child's attention, the greater promise it gives that
an "abstract process," an "imaginative creation" will
follow as the result of a developed potentiality. This
creative imagination, which is ever returning to reality to
gain inspiration and to acquire new energies, will not be
a vain, exhaustible, and fickle thing, like the so-called imagination
which our ordinary schools are trying to develop.</p>

<p>Without positive replenishment in reality there never
will be a spontaneous flight of the mind; this is the unsurmountable
difficulty of the common schools in their attempt
to "develop the imagination" and to "lead to education."
The child who without any impelling force from
within is artificially "borne aloft" by the teacher, who
forces him into the "abstract," can at most learn only
how to descend slowly like a parachute. He can never
learn to "lift himself energetically to dizzy heights."
This is the difference; hence the necessity for considering
the positive basis which holds the mind of the child to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
systematic auto-exercises of preparation. After this it
suffices merely to grant freedom to the child's genius in
order that it may take its own flight.</p>

<p>I need not repeat that even in the period of replenishing,
freedom is the guide in finding the "particular moment"
and the "necessary time"; for I already have spoken
insistently and at length concerning this. It is well, however,
to reaffirm here even more clearly that a material for
development predetermined by experimental research and
put into relation with the child (through lessons) accomplishes
so complete a work by the psychic reactions
which it is capable of stimulating that marvelous phenomena
of intellectual development may be obtained.
These geometric insets furnish rich materials for the application
of this principle and respond wonderfully to the
"instinct for work" in the child mind.</p>

<p>The exercises with this material not only are exercises
of composition with the pieces of an inset or of the substitution
of them into their relative metal plates; they are
also exercises in drawing which, because of the labor they
require, allow the child to take cognizance of every detail
and to meditate upon it.</p>

<p>The designing done with these geometric insets, as will
be explained, is of two kinds: geometric and artistic (mechanical
and decorative). And the union of the two kinds
of drawings gives new ways of applying the material.</p>

<p>The geometric design consists in reproducing the figure
outlined by the corresponding insets. In this way the
child learns to use the different instruments of drawing&mdash;the
square, the ruler, the compass, and the protractor. In
these exercises he acquires, with the aid of the special portfolio
which comes with the material, actual and real cognitions
in geometry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Artistic designs are made by combining the small pieces
of the various geometric insets. The resulting figures are
then outlined and filled in with colored pencils or watercolors.
Such combinations on the part of the child are
real esthetic creations. The insets are of such reciprocal
proportions that their combination results in an artistic
harmony which facilitates the development of the child's
esthetic sense. With our insets we were able to reproduce
some of the classic decorations found in our masterpieces
of art, such as decorations by Giotto.</p>

<p>A combination of geometric design and artistic design
is formed by decorating the different parts of the geometric
figure&mdash;as the center, the sides, the angles, the circumference,
etc.; or by elaborating with free-hand details the
decorations which have resulted from the combination of
the insets. But a far better concept of all this will be
gained as we pass on to explain our didactic material.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Equivalent, Identical and Similar Figures</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">First Series of Insets:</span> <i>Squares and Divided Figures.</i>
This is a series of nine square insets, ten by ten
centimeters, each of which has a white foundation of the
same size as the inset.</p>

<p>One inset consists of an entire square; the others are
made up in the following manner:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The child can take the square divided into two rectangles
and the one divided into two triangles and interchange
them: that is, he can build the first square with triangles
and the second with rectangles. The two triangles
can be superimposed by placing them in contact at the
under side where there is no knob, and the same can be
done with the rectangles, thus showing their equivalence
by placing one on the other. But there also is a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
relation between the triangles and the rectangles; indeed,
they are each half of the same square; yet they differ
greatly in form. Inductively the child gains an idea of
equivalent figures. The two triangles are identical; the
two rectangles also are identical; whereas the triangle and
the rectangle are equivalents. The child soon makes comparisons
by placing the triangle on the rectangle, and he
notices at once that the small triangle which is left over
on the rectangle equals the small triangle which remains
uncovered on the larger triangle, and therefore that the
triangle and the rectangle, though they do not have the
same form, have the same area.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="430" height="217" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>This exercise in observation is repeated in a like manner
with all the other insets, which are divided successively
into four, eight, and sixteen parts. The small
square which is a fourth of the original square, resulting
from the division of this latter by two medial lines, is
equivalent to the triangle which was formed by dividing
this same original square into four triangles by two diagonal
lines. And so on.</p>

<p>By comparing the different figures the child learns the
difference between <i>equivalent</i> figures and <i>identical</i> figures.
The two rectangles are the result of dividing the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
square by a medial line and are identical; the two triangles
are formed by dividing the original square by a diagonal
line, etc. <i>Similar</i> figures, on the other hand, are
those which have the same form but differ in dimension.
For example, the rectangle which is half of the original
square and the one which is half of the smaller square&mdash;that
is, an eighth of the original square&mdash;are neither
identical nor equivalent but they are <i>similar</i> figures. The
same may be said of the large square and of the smaller
ones which represent a fourth, a sixteenth, etc.</p>

<p>Through these divisions of the square an idea of fractions
is gained intuitively. However, this is not the material
used for the study of fractions. For this purpose
there is another series of insets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Series of Insets:</span> <i>Fractions.</i> There are ten
metal plates, each of which has a circular opening ten centimeters
in diameter. One inset is a complete circle; the
other circular insets are divided respectively into 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 equal parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/i_267.jpg" width="435" height="132" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>The children learn to measure the angles of each piece,
and so to count the degrees. For this work there is a circular
piece of white card-board, on which is drawn in black
a semicircle with a radius of the same length as that of the
circular insets. This semicircle is divided into 18 sectors
by radii which extend beyond the circumference on to
the background; and these radii are numbered by tens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
from 0° to 180°. Each sector is then subdivided into
ten parts or degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/i_268.jpg" width="410" height="218" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>The diameter from 0° to 180° is outlined heavily and
extends beyond the circumference, in order to facilitate
the adjustment of the angle to be measured and to give
a strict exactness of position. This is done also with the
radius which marks 90°. The child places a piece of an
inset in such a way that the vertex of the angle touches
the middle of the diameter and one of its sides rests on the
radius marked 0°. At the other end of the arc of the
inset he can read the degrees of the angle. After these
exercises, the children are able to measure any angle with
a common protractor. Furthermore, they learn that a
circle measures 360°, half a circle 180°, and a right angle
90°. Once having learned that a circumference measures
360° they can find the number of degrees in any angle;
for example, in the angle of an inset representing the
seventh of the circle, they know that 360° ÷ 7 = (approximately)
51°. This they can easily verify with their
instruments by placing the sector on the graduated circle.</p>

<p>These calculations and measurements are repeated with
all the different sectors of this series of insets where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
circle is divided into from two to ten parts. The protractor
shows approximately that:</p>

<p>In this way the child learns to write fractions:</p>

<div class='center'>
1/2  1/3  1/4  1/5  1/6  1/7  1/8  1/9  1/10<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>He has concrete impressions of them as well as an intuition
of their arithmetical relationships.</div>

<p>The material lends itself to an infinite number of combinations,
all of which are real arithmetical exercises in
fractions. For example, the child can take from the
circle the two half circles and replace them by four sectors
of 90°, filling the same circular opening with entirely different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
pieces. From this he can draw the following conclusion:</p>

<div class='center'>1/2 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4.</div>

<p>He also may say that two halves are equal to four
fourths, and write accordingly:</p>

<div class='center'>2/2 = 4/4.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i_270.jpg" width="440" height="337" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>This is merely the expression of the same thing. Seeing
the pieces, he has done an example mentally and then
has written it out. Let us write it according to the first
form, which is, in reality, an analysis of this example:</p>

<div class='center'>1/2 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4.</div>

<p>When the denominator is the same, the sum of the
fractions is found by adding the numerators:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2; 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4.</div>

<p>The two halves make an entire circle, as do the four
fourths.</p>

<p>Now let us fill a circle with different pieces: for example,
with a half circle and two quarter circles. The
result is 1 = 1/2 + 2/4. And in the inset itself it is
shown that 1/2 = 2/4. If we should wish to fill the circle
with the largest piece (1/2) combined with the fewest
number of pieces possible, it would be necessary to withdraw
the two quarter sectors and replace them by another
half circle; result:</p>

<div class='center'>1 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2 = 1.</div>

<p>Let us fill a circle with three 1/5 sectors and four 1/10
sectors:</p>

<div class='center'>1 = 3/5 + 4/10.</div>

<div class='unindent'>If the larger pieces are left in and the circle is then
filled with the fewest number of pieces possible, it would
necessitate replacing the four tenths by two fifths.
Result:</div>

<div class='center'>1 = 3/5 + 2/5 = 5/5 = 1.</div>

<p>Let us fill the circle thus: 5/10 + 1/4 + 2/8 = 1.</p>

<p>Now try to put in the largest pieces possible by substituting
for several small pieces a large piece which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
equal to them. In the space occupied by the five tenths
may be placed one half, and in that occupied by the two
eighths, one fourth; then the circle is filled thus:</p>

<div class='center'>1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 + 2/4.</div>

<p>We can continue to do the same thing, that is to replace
the smaller pieces by as large a sector as possible,
and the two fourths can be replaced by another half circle.
Result:</p>

<div class='center'>1 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2 = 1.</div>

<p>All these substitutions may be expressed in figures thus:</p>

<div class='center'>5/10 + 1/4 + 2/8 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 + 2/4 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2 = 1.</div>

<p>This is one means of initiating a child intuitively into
the operations used for the reduction of fractions to their
lowest terms.</p>

<p>Improper fractions also interest them very much.
They come to these by adding a number of sectors which
fill two, three, or four circles. To find the whole numbers
which exist under the guise of fractions is a little
like putting away in their proper places the circular insets
which have been all mixed up. The children manifest
a desire to learn the real operations of fractions.
With improper fractions they originate most unusual
sums, like the following:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<span class='u'>[8 + (7/7 + 18/9 + 24/2) + 1] =</span><br />
8<br />
<br />
<span class='u'>[8 + (1 + 2 + 12) + 1] =</span><br />
8<br />
<br />
<span class='u'>8 + 15 + 1</span> = 24/8 = 3.<br />
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">8</span><br />
</div>


<p>We have a series of commands which may be used as a
guide for the child's work. Here are some examples:</p>

<div class='list1'>
&mdash;Take 1/5 of 25 beads<br />
<br />
&mdash;Take 1/4  " 36 counters<br />
<br />
&mdash;Take 1/6  " 24 beans<br />
<br />
&mdash;Take 1/3  " 27 beans<br />
<br />
&mdash;Take 1/10 " 40 beans<br />
<br />
&mdash;Take 2/5  " 60 counters<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>In this last there are two operations:</div>

<div class='center'>60 ÷ 5 = 12; 12 X 2 = 24; or 2 X 60 = 120;
120 ÷ 5 = 24, etc.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Reduction of Common Fractions to Decimal Fractions:</span>
The material for this purpose is similar to that
of the circular insets, except that the frame is white and
is marked into ten equal parts, and each part is then subdivided
into ten. In these subdivisions the little line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
which marks the five is distinguished from the others by
its greater length. Each of the larger divisions is
marked respectively with the numbers, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 90, and 0. The 0 is at the top and there is a
raised radius against which are placed the sectors to be
measured.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i_274.jpg" width="380" height="378" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>To reduce a common fraction to a decimal fraction the
sector is placed carefully against the raised radius, with
the arc touching the circumference of the inset. Where
the arc ends there is a number which represents <i>the hundredths</i>
corresponding to the sector. For example, if the
1/4 sector is used its arc ends at 25; hence 1/4 equals 0.25.</p>



<p><a href="#Page_275">Page 275</a> shows in detail the practical method of using
our material to reduce common fractions to decimal fractions.
In the upper figure the segments correspond to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a><br /><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
1/3, 1/4, and 1/8 of a circle are placed within the circle divided
into hundredths. Result:</p>

<div class='center'>
1/3 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 0.70.<br />
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="364" height="738" alt="drawing" />
</div>
<p>The lower figure shows how the 1/3 sector is placed: 1/3
= 0.33.</p>

<p>If instead we use the 1/5 sector we have: 1/5 = 0.20, etc.</p>

<p>Numerous sectors may be placed within the circle; for
example:</p>

<div class='center'>
1/4 + 1/7 + 1/9 + 1/10.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>In order to find the sum of the fraction reduced to decimals,
it is necessary to read only the number at the outer
edge of the last sector.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="433" height="188" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Using this as a basis, it is very easy to develop an
arithmetical idea. Instead of 1, which represents the
whole circle, let us write 100, which represents its subdivisions
when used for decimals, and let us divide the
100 into as many parts of a circle as there are sectors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the circle, and the reduction is made. All the parts which
result are so many hundredths. Hence:</p>

<div class='center'>1/4 = 100 ÷ 4 = 25 hundredths: that is, 25/100 or 0.25.</div>

<p>The division is performed by dividing the numerator
by the demoninator:</p>

<div class='center'>
1 ÷ 4 = 0.25.<br />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Third Series of Insets</span>: <i>Equivalent Figures.</i> Two
concepts were given by the squares divided into rectangles
and triangles: that of fractions and that of equivalent
figures.</p>

<p>There is a special material for the concept of fractions
which, besides developing the intuitive notion of
fractions, has permitted the solution of examples in fractions
and of reducing fractions to decimals; and it has
furthermore brought cognizance of other things, such as
the measuring of angles in terms of degrees.</p>

<p>For the concept of equivalent figures there is still another
material. This will lead to finding the area of different
geometric forms and also to an intuition of some
theorems which heretofore have been foreign to elementary
schools, being considered beyond the understanding
of a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Material</span>: Showing that a triangle is equal to a
rectangle which has one side equal to the base of the triangle,
the other side equal to half of the altitude of the
triangle.</p>

<p>In a large rectangular metal frame there are two white
openings: the triangle and the equivalent rectangle. The
pieces which compose the rectangle are such that they
may fit into the openings of either the rectangle or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
triangle. This demonstrates that the rectangle and the
triangle are equivalent. The triangular space is filled by
two pieces formed by a horizontal line drawn through the
triangle parallel to the base and crossing at half the altitude.
Taking the two pieces out and putting them one
on top of the other the identity of the height may be verified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="424" height="260" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>Already the work with the beads and the squaring of
numbers has led to finding the area of a square by multiplying
one side by the other; and in like manner the area
of a rectangle is found by multiplying the base by half
other. Since a triangle may be reduced to a rectangle,
it is easy to find its area by multiplying the base by half
the height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> Showing that a rhombus is equal to a rectangle
which has one side equal to one side of the rhombus
and the other equal to the height of the rhombus.</p>

<p>The frame contains a rhombus divided by a diagonal
line into two triangles and a rectangle filled with pieces
which can be put into the rhombus when the triangles have
been removed, and will fill it completely. In the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
there are also an entire rhombus and an entire rectangle.
If they are placed one on top of the other they will be
found to have the same height. As the equivalence of the
two figures is demonstrated by these pieces of the rectangle
which may be used to fill in the two figures, it
is easily seen that the area of a rhombus is found by multiplying
the side or base by the height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> To show the equivalence of a trapezoid
and a rectangle having one side equal to the sum of the
two bases and the other equal to half the height.</p>

<p>The child himself can make the other comparison: that
is, a trapezoid equals a rectangle having one side equal
to the height and the other equal to one-half the sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the bases. For the latter it is only necessary to cut the
long rectangle in half and superimpose the two halves.</p>

<p>The large rectangular frame contains three openings:
two equal trapezoids and the equivalent rectangle having
one side equal to the sum of the two bases and the other
side equal to half the height. One trapezoid is made of
two pieces, being cut in half horizontally at the height of
half its altitude; the identity in height may be proved
by placing one piece on top of the other. The second
trapezoid is composed of pieces which can be placed in
the rectangle, filling it completely. Thus the equivalence
is proved and also the fact that the area of a trapezoid
is found by multiplying the sum of the bases by half the
height, or half the sum of the bases by the height.</p>

<span class="caption">The analysis of the decagon.</span>
</div>

<p>In the material there are two decagon insets, one consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a><br /><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of a whole decagon and the other of a decagon divided
into ten triangles.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_281">Page 281</a> shows a table taken from our geometry portfolio,
representing the equivalence of a decagon to a rectangle
having one side equal to the perimeter and the other
equal to half the hypotenuse.</p>

<img src="images/fp_282.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">The bead number cubes built into a tower.</span>
</div>

<p>The photograph shows the pieces of the insets&mdash;the
decagon and the equivalent rectangle&mdash;and beneath each
one there are the small equal triangles into which it can be
subdivided. Here it is demonstrated that a rectangle
equivalent to a decagon may have one side equal to the
whole hypotenuse and the other equal to half of the perimeter.</p>

<p>Another inset shows the equivalence of the decagon and
a rectangle which has one side equal to the perimeter of
the decagon and the other equal to half of the altitude
of each triangle composing the decagon. Small triangles
divided horizontally in half can be fitted into this figure,
with one of the upper triangles divided in half lengthwise.</p>

<p>Thus we demonstrate that the surface of a regular
polygon may be found by multiplying the perimeter by
half the hypotenuse.</p>


<h3>SOME THEOREMS BASED ON EQUIVALENT FIGURES</h3>

<p><i>A.</i> All triangles having the same base and altitude are
equal.</p>

<p>This is easily understood from the fact that the area of
a triangle is found by multiplying the base by half the
altitude; therefore triangles having the same base and the
same altitude must be equal.</p>

<p>For the inductive demonstration of this theorem we
have the following material: The rhombus and the equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
rectangle are each divided into two triangles. The
triangles of the rhombus are different, for they are divided
by opposite diagonal lines. The three different triangles
resulting from these divisions have the same base
(this can be actually verified by measuring the bases of
the different pieces) and fit into the same long rectangle
which is found below the first three figures. Therefore, it
is demonstrated that the three triangles have the same altitude.
They are equivalent because each one is the half
of an equivalent figure.</p>

<img src="images/i_283.jpg" width="427" height="219" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p><i>B.</i> <span class="smcap">The Theorem of Pythagoras:</span> In a right-angled
triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to
the sum of the squares of the two sides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> The material illustrates three different
cases:</p>

<div class='hang2'>First case: In which the two sides of the triangle
are equal.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Second case: In which the two sides are in the proportion
of 3:4.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Third case: General.</div>

<p><i>First case:</i> The demonstration of this first case affords
an impressive induction.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>In the frame for this, shown below, the squares of the
two sides are divided in half by a diagonal line so as to
form two triangles and the square of the hypotenuse is
divided by two diagonal lines into four triangles. The
eight resulting triangles are all identical; hence the triangles
of the squares of the two sides will fill the square
of the hypotenuse; and, vice versa, the four triangles of
the square of the hypotenuse may be used to fill the two
squares of the sides. The substitution of these different
pieces is very interesting, and all the more because the triangles
of the squares of the sides are all of the same color,
whereas the triangles formed in the square of the hypotenuse
are of a different color.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/i_284.jpg" width="429" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Second case:</i> Where the sides are as the proportion
of 3:4.</p>

<p>In this figure the three squares are filled with small
squares of three different colors, arranged as follows: in
the square on the shorter side, 3<sup>2</sup> = 9; in that on the
larger side, 4<sup>2</sup> = 16; in that on the hypotenuse, 5<sup>2</sup> = 25.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/i_285.jpg" width="319" height="600" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Second Case</span>
</div>

<p>The substitution game suggests itself. The two
squares formed on the sides can be entirely filled by
the small squares composing the square on the hypotenuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a><br /><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
so that they are both of the same color; while the square
formed on the hypotenuse can be filled with varied designs
by various combinations of the small squares of the sides
which are in two different colors.</p>

<p><i>Third case:</i> This is the general case.</p>

<p>The large frame is somewhat complicated and difficult
to describe. It develops a considerable intellectual exercise.
The entire frame measures 44 × 24 cm. and may
be likened to a chess-board, where the movable pieces are
susceptible of various combinations. The principles already
proved or inductively suggested which lead to the
demonstration of the theorem are:</p>

<p>(1) That two quadrilaterals having an equal base and
equal altitude are equivalent.</p>

<p>(2) That two figures equivalent to a third figure are
equivalent to each other.</p>

<p>In this figure the square formed on the hypotenuse is
divided into two rectangles. The additional side is determined
by the division made in the hypotenuse by
dropping a perpendicular line from the apex of the triangle
to the hypotenuse. There are also two rhomboids
in this frame, each of which has one side equal respectively
to the large and to the small square of the sides
of the triangle and the other side equal to the hypotenuse.</p>

<p>The shorter altitude of the two rhomboids, as may be
seen in the figure itself, corresponds to the respective altitudes,
or shorter sides, of the rectangles. But the longer
side corresponds respectively to the side of the larger and
of the smaller squares of the sides of the triangle.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that these corresponding dimensions
be known by the child. He sees red and yellow pieces of
an inset and simply moves them about, placing them in
the indentures of the frame. It is the fact that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
movable pieces actually fit into this white background
which gives the child the opportunity for reasoning out
the theorem, and not the abstract idea of the corresponding
relations between the dimensions of the sides and the
different heights of the figures. Reduced to these terms
the exercise is easily performed and proves very interesting.</p>

<p>This material may be used for other demonstrations:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demonstration A:</span> <i>The substitution of the pieces.</i>
Let us start with the frame as it should be filled originally.
First take out the two rectangles formed on the hypotenuse;
place them in the two lateral grooves, and lower
the triangle. Fill the remaining empty space with the
two rhomboids.</p>

<p>The same space is filled in both cases with:</p>

<div class='list1'>
A triangle plus two rectangles, and then<br />
A triangle plus two rhomboids.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Hence the sum of the two rectangles (which form the
square of the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the two
rhomboids.</div>

<p>In a later substitution we consider the rhomboids instead
of the rectangles in order to demonstrate their respective
equivalence to the two squares formed on the
sides of the triangle. Beginning, for example with the
larger square, we start with the insets in the original position
and consider the space occupied by the triangle
and the larger square. To analyze this space the pieces
are all taken out and then it is filled successively by:</p>

<div class='list2'>
The triangle and the large square in their original positions.<br />
The triangle and the large rhomboid.<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/fp_288.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">Showing that the two rhomboids are equal to the two rectangles.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Demonstration B</span>: <i>Based on Equivalence</i>. In this
second demonstration the relative equivalence of the
rhomboid, the rectangles, and the squares is shown outside
the figure by means of the parallel indentures which
are on both sides of the frame. These indentures, when
the pieces are placed in them, show that the pieces have
the same altitude.</p>

<p>This is the manner of procedure: Starting again with
the original position, take out the two rectangles and
place them in the parallel indentures to the left, the
larger in the wider indenture and the smaller in the narrower
indenture. The different figures in the same indenture
have the same altitude; therefore the pieces need
only to be placed together at the base to prove that they
are equal&mdash;hence the figures are equal in pairs: the
smaller rectangle equals the smaller rhomboid and the
larger rectangle equals the larger rhomboid.</p>

<p>Starting again from the original position you proceed
analogously with the squares. In the parallel indentures
to the right the large square may be placed in the same
indenture with the large rhomboid, which, however, must
be turned in the opposite direction (in the direction of
its greatest length); and the smaller square and the
smaller rhomboid fit into the narrower indenture. They
have the same altitude; and that the bases are equal is
easily verified by putting them together; therefore here
is proof that the squares and the rhomboids are respectively
equivalent.</p>

<p>Rectangles and squares which are equivalent to the
same rhomboids are equivalent to each other. Hence the
theorem is proved.</p>

</div>

<p>This series of geometric material is used for other purposes,
but they are of minor importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Series of Insets</span>: <i>Division of a Triangle</i>.
This material made up of four frames of equal size,
each containing an equilateral triangle measuring ten centimeters
to a side. The different pieces should fill the triangular
spaces exactly.</p>

<p>One is filled by an entire equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>One is filled by two rectangular scalene triangles, each
equal to half of the original equilateral triangle, which
is bisected by dropping a line perpendicularly to the base.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/i_289.jpg" width="423" height="329" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>The third is filled by three obtuse isosceles triangles,
formed by lines bisecting the three angles of the original
triangle.</p>

<p>The fourth is divided into four equilateral triangles
which are similar in shape to the original triangle.</p>

<p>With these triangles a child can make a more exact
analytical study than he made when he was observing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a><br /><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
triangles of the plane insets used in the "Children's
House." He measures the degrees of the angles and
learns to distinguish a right angle (90°) from an acute
angle (&lt;90°) and from an obtuse angle (&gt;90°).</p>

<p>Furthermore he finds in measuring the angles of any
triangle that their sum is always equal to 180° or to two
right angles.</p>

<p>He can observe that in equilateral triangles all the
angles are equal (60°); that in the isosceles triangle the
two angles at the opposite ends of the unequal side are
equal; while in the scalene triangle no two angles are
alike. In the right-angled triangle the sum of the two
acute angles is equal to a right angle. A general definition
is that those triangles are similar in which the corresponding
angles are equal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material for Inscribed and Concentric Figures</span>:
In this material, which for the most part is made up of
that already described, and which is therefore merely an
application of it, inscribed or concentric figures may be
placed in the white background of the different inset
frames. For example, on the white background of the
large equilateral triangle the small red equilateral triangle,
which is a fourth of it, may be placed in such a
way that each vertex is tangent to the middle of each
side of the larger triangle.</p>

<p>There are also two squares, one of 7 centimeters on
a side and the other 3.5. They have their respective
frames with white backgrounds. The 7 centimeters
square may be placed on the background of the 10 centimeters
square in such a way that each corner touches the
middle of each side of the frame. In like manner the 5
centimeters square, which is a fourth of the large square,
may be put in the 7 centimeters square; the 3.5 centimeters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
square in the 5 centimeters square; and finally the
tiny square, which is 1/16 part of the large square, in the
3.5 centimeters square.</p>

<p>There is also a circle which is tangent to the edges
of the large equilateral triangle. This circle may be
placed on the background of the 10 centimeters circle, and
in that case a white circular strip remains all the way
round (concentric circles). Within this circle the smaller
equilateral triangle (1/4 of the large triangle) is perfectly
inscribed. Then there is a small circle which is tangent
to the smallest equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>Besides these circles which are used with the triangles
there are two others tangent to the squares: one to the
7 centimeters square and the other to the 3.5 centimeters
square. The large circle, 10 centimeters in diameter,
fits exactly into the 10 centimeters square; and the other
circles are concentric to it.</p>

<p>These corresponding relations make the figures easily
adaptable to our artistic composition of decorative design
(see following chapter).</p>

<p>Finally, together with the other material, there are
two stars which are also used for decorative design. The
two stars, or "flowers," are based on the 3.5 centimeters
square. In one the circle rests on the side as a semi-circle
(simple flower); and in the other the same circle goes
around the vertex and beyond the semi-circle until it meets
the reciprocal of four circles (flower and foliage).</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SOLID GEOMETRY</div>


<p>Since the children already know how to find the area
of ordinary geometric forms it is very easy, with the
knowledge of the arithmetic they have acquired through
work with the beads (the square and cube of numbers),
to initiate them into the manner of finding the volume
of solids. After having studied the cube of numbers by
the aid of the cube of beads it is easy to recognize the
fact that the volume of a prism is found by multiplying
the area by the altitude.</p>

<p>In our didactic material we have three objects for solid
geometry: a prism, a pyramid having the same base and
altitude, and a prism with the same base but with only
one-third the altitude. They are all empty. The two
prisms have a cover and are really boxes; the uncovered
pyramid can be filled with different substances and then
emptied, serving as a sort of scoop.</p>

<p>These solids may be filled with wheat or sand. Thus
we put into practise the same technique as is used to calculate
capacity, as in anthropology, for instance, when we
wish to measure the capacity of a cranium.</p>

<p>It is difficult to fill a receptacle completely in such a
way that the measured result does not vary; so we usually
put in a scarce measure, which therefore does not correspond
to the exact volume but to a smaller volume.</p>

<p>One must know how to fill a receptacle, just as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
must know how to do up a bundle, so that the various objects
may take up the least possible space. The children
like this exercise of shaking the receptacle and getting
in as great a quantity as possible; and they like to level
it off when it is entirely filled.</p>

<p>The receptacles may be filled also with liquids. In this
case the child must be careful to pour out the contents
without losing a single drop. This technical drill serves
as a preparation for using metric measures.</p>

<p>By these experiments the child finds that the pyramid
has the same volume as the small prism (which is one-third
of the large prism); hence the volume of the pyramid
is found by multiplying the area of the base by one-third
the altitude. The small prism may be filled with clay
and the same piece of clay will be found to fill the pyramid.
The two solids of equal volume may be made of
clay. All three solids can be made by taking five times
as much clay as is needed to fill the same prism.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>Having mastered these fundamental ideas, it is easy
to study the rest, and few explanations will be needed.
In many cases the incentive to do original problems
may be developed by giving the children definite examples:
as, how can the area of a circle be found? the volume
of a cylinder? of a cone? Problems on the total
area of some solids also may be suggested. Many times
the children will risk spontaneous inductions and often
of their own accord proceed to measure the total surface
area of all the solids at their disposal, even going back to
the materials used in the "Children's House."</p>

<p>The material includes a series of wooden solids with a
base measurement of 10 cm.:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Applications</span>: <i>The Powers of Numbers</i>.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Material</span>: Two equal cubes of 2 cm. on a side; a
prism twice the size of the cubes; a prism double this preceding
prism; seven cubes 4 cm. on a side.</p>

<p>The following combinations are made:</p>

<blockquote><p>The two smaller cubes are placed side by side = 2.</p>

<p>In front of these is placed the prism which is twice
as large as the cube = 2<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>On top of these is placed the double prism, making
a cube with 4 cm. on a side = 2<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>One of the seven cubes is put beside this = 2<sup>4</sup>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>In front are placed two more of the seven cubes
= 2<sup>5</sup>.</p>

<p>On top are put the remaining four equal cubes = 2<sup>6</sup>.</p>

<p>In this way we have made a cube measuring 8 cm. on
a side. From this we see that:</p>

<div class='indent'>
2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>6</sup> have the form of a cube.<br />
2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup> have the form of a square.<br />

</div>

<p><i>The Cube of a Binomial:</i> (a + b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + 3a<sup>2</sup>b

<p><span class="smcap">Material:</span> A cube with a 6 cm. edge, a cube with
a 4 cm. edge; three prisms with a square base of 4 cm.
on a side and 6 cm. high; three prisms with a square base
of 6 cm. to a side and 4 cm. high. The 10 cm. cube can
be made with these.</p>

<p>These two combinations are in special cube-shaped
boxes into which the 10 cm. cube fits exactly.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p><i>Weights and Measures:</i> All that refers to weights
and measures is merely an application of similar operations
and reasonings.</p>

<p>The children have at their disposal and learn to handle
many of the objects which are used for measuring both
in commerce and in every-day life. In the "Children's
House" days they had the long stair rods which contain
the meter and its decimeter subdivisions. Here
they have a tape-measure with which they measure floors,
etc., and find the area. They have the meter in many
forms: in the anthropometer, in the ruler. Then, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
they use the metal tape, the dressmaker's tape measure,
and the meterstick used by merchants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">

<span class="caption">Hollow geometric solids, used for determining equivalence by measuring
sand, sugar, etc.</span>
</div>

<p>The twenty centimeter ruler divided into millimeters
they use constantly in design; and they love to calculate
the area of the geometric figures they have designed or
of the metal insets. Often they calculate the surface of
the white background of an inset and that of the different
pieces which exactly fit this opening, so as to verify
the former. As they already have some preparation in
decimals it is no task for them to recognize and to remember
that the measures increase by tens and take on new
names each time. The exercises in grammar have greatly
facilitated the increase in their vocabulary.</p>

<p>They calculate the reciprocal relations between length,
surface, and volume by going back to the three sets which
first represented "long," "thick," and "large."</p>

<p>The objects which differ in length vary by 10's;
those differing in areas vary by 100's; and those which
differ in volume vary by 1000's.</p>

<p>The comparison between the bead material and the
cubes of the pink tower (one of the first things they built)
encourages a more profound study of the sensory objects
which were once the subject of assiduous application.</p>

<p>By the aid of the double decimeter the children make
the calculations for finding the volume of all the different
objects graded by tens, such as the rods, the prisms of
the broad stair, the cubes of the pink tower.</p>

<p>By taking the extremes in each case they learn the relations
between objects which differ in one dimension, in
two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Besides, they
already know that the square of 10 is 100, and the cube
of 10 is 1000.</p>

</div>

<p>The children make use of various scientific instruments:
thermometers, distillers, scales, and, as previously stated,
the principal measures commonly used.</p>

<p>By filling an empty metal cubical decimeter, which like
the geometric solids is used for the calculation of volume,
they have a liter measure of water, which may be poured
into a glass liter bottle. All the decimal multiples and
subdivisions of the liter are easily understood. Our children
spent much time pouring liquids into all the small
measures used in commerce for measuring wine and oil.</p>

<p>They distil water with the distiller. They use the thermometer
to measure the temperature of water in ebullition
and the temperature of the freezing mixture. They
take the water which is used to determine the weight of
the kilogram, keeping it at the temperature of 4°C.</p>

<p>The objects which serve to measure capacity also are
at the disposal of the children.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into more details upon the multitudinous
consequences resulting from both a methodical
preparation of the intellect and the possibility of actually
being in contact with real objects.</p>

<p>A great number of problems given by us, as well as
problems originated by the children themselves, bear witness
to the ease with which external effects may he spontaneously
produced when once the inner <i>causes</i> have been
adequately stimulated.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a><br /><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LINEAR GEOMETRIC DESIGN DECORATION</div>


<p>I already have mentioned the fact that the material of
the geometric insets may be applied also to design.</p>

<p>It is through design that the child may be led to ponder
on the geometric figures which he has handled, taken
out, combined in numerous ways, and replaced. In doing
this he completes an exercise necessitating much use
of the reasoning faculties. Indeed, he reproduces all of
the figures by linear design, learning to handle many instruments&mdash;the
centimeter ruler, the double decimeter,
the square, the protractor, the compass, and the steel pen
used for line ruling. For this work we have included in
the geometric material a large portfolio where, together
with the pages reproducing the figures, there are also some
illustrative sheets with brief explanations of the figures
and containing the relative nomenclature. Aside from
copying designs the child may copy also the explanatory
notes and thus reproduce the whole geometry portfolio.
These explanatory notes are very simple. Here, for example,
is the one which refers to the square:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Square:</span> The side or base is divided into 10 cm. All
the other sides are equal, hence each measures 10 cm.
The square has four equal sides and four equal angles
which are always right angles. The number 4 and the
identity of the sides and angles are the distinguishing
characteristics of the square."</p>

<p>The children measure paper and construct the figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
with attention and application that are truly remarkable.
They love to handle the compasses and are very
proud of possessing a pair.</p>

<p>One child asked her mother for a Christmas gift of
"one <i>last</i> doll and a box of compasses," as if she were
ending one epoch of her life and beginning another. One
little boy begged his mother to let him accompany her
when she went to buy the compass for him. When they
were in the store the salesman was surprised to find
that so young a child was to use the compass and gave
them a box of the simplest kind. "Not those," protested
the little fellow; "I want an engineer's compass;" and
he picked out one of the most complicated ones. This
was the very reason why he was so anxious to go with
his mother.</p>

<p>As the children draw, they learn many particulars concerning
the geometric figures: the sides, angles, bases, centers,
median lines, radii, diameters, sectors, segments, diagonals,
hypotenuses, circumferences, perimeters, etc. They
do not, however, learn all this as so much dry information
nor do they limit themselves to reproducing the designs
in the geometry portfolio. Each child adds to his
own portfolio other designs which he chooses and sometimes
originates. The designs reproduced in the portfolio
are drawn on plain white drawing paper with China
inks, but the children's special designs are drawn on
colored paper with different colored inks and with gildings
(silver, gold). The children reproduce the geometric
figures and then they fill them in with decorations
made either with pen or water-colors. These decorations
serve especially to emphasize, in a geometric
analysis, the various parts of the figure, such as center,
angles, circumference, medians, diagonals, etc.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The decorated motif is selected or else invented by the
child himself. He is allowed the same freedom of choice
in his backgrounds as he enjoys for his inks or water-colors.
The observation of nature (flowers and their
different parts&mdash;pollen, leaves, a section of some part
observed under the microscope, plant seeds, shells, etc.)
serves to nourish the child's æsthetic imagination. The
children also have access to artistic designs, collections
of photographs reproducing the great masterpieces, and
Haeckel's famous work, <i>Nature's Artistic Forms</i>, all of
which equipment is so interesting and delightful to a
child.</p>

<p>The children work many, many hours on drawing.
This is the time we seize for reading to them (see above
p. 197) and almost all their history is learned during this
quiet period of copy and simple decoration which is so
conducive to concentration of thought.</p>

<p>Copying some design, or drawing a decoration which
has been directly inspired by something seen; the choice
of colors to fill in a geometric figure or to bring out, by
small and simple designs, the center or side of the figure;
the mechanical act of mixing a color, of dissolving the
gildings, or of choosing one kind of ink from a series of
different colors; sharpening a pencil, or getting one's
paper in the proper position; determining through tentative
means the required extension of the compass&mdash;all
this is a complex operation requiring patience and exactitude.
But it does not require great intellectual concentration.
It is, therefore, a work of application rather
than of inspiration; and the observation of each detail,
in order to reproduce it exactly, clarifies and rests the
mind instead of rousing it to the intense activity demanded
by the labor of association and creation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
child is busy with his hands rather than with his mind;
but yet his mind is sufficiently stimulated by this work as
not easily to wander away into the world of dreams.</p>

<p>These are quiet hours of work in which the children
use only a part of their energies, while the other part is
reaching out after something else; just as a family sits
quietly by the fireside in long winter evenings engaged
in light manual labors requiring little intelligence, watching
the flames with a sense of enjoyment, willing to pass
in this way many peaceful hours, yet feeling that a certain
side of their needs is not satisfied. This is the time
chosen for story telling or for light reading. Similarly
this is the best time for our little children to listen to
reading of all kinds.</p>

<p>During these hours they listened to the reading of
books like <i>The Betrothed</i> (of Manzoni), psychological
books like Itard's <i>Education of the Savage of Aveyron</i>,
or historical narratives. The children took a deep interest
in the reading. Each child may be occupied with his
own design as well as with the facts which he is hearing
described. It seems as though the one occupation furnishes
the energy necessary for perfection in the other.
The mechanical attention which the child gives to his design
frees his mind from idle dreaming and renders it
more capable of completely absorbing the reading that
is going on; and the pleasure gained from the reading
which, little by little, penetrates his whole being seems
to give new energy to both hand and eye. His lines become
most exact and the colors more delicate.</p>

<p>When the reading has reached some point of climax
we hear remarks, exclamations, applause or discussions,
which animate and lighten the work without interrupting
it. But there are times when, with one accord, our children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
abandon their drawing so as to act out some humorous
selection or to represent an historical fact which
has touched them deeply; or, indeed, as happened during
the reading of the <i>Savage of Aveyron</i>, their hands
remained almost unconsciously raised in the intensity of
their emotion, while on their faces was an expression of
ecstasy, as if they were witnessing wonderful unheard-of
things. Their actions seemed to interpret the well-known
sentiment: "Never have I seen woman like unto
this."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artistic Composition with the Insets:</span> Our geometric
insets, which are all definitely related to one another
in dimensions and include a series of figures which
can be contained one within the other, lend themselves to
very beautiful combinations. With these the children
make real creations and often follow out their artistic
ideas for days and even weeks. By moving the small
pieces or by combining them in different ways on the
white background, these very insets produce various decorations.
The ease with which the child may form designs
by arranging the little pieces of iron on a sheet of
paper and then outlining them, and the harmony which
is thus so easily obtained, affords endless delight. Really
wonderful pieces of work are often produced in this way.</p>

<p>During these periods of creative design, as indeed during
the periods of drawing from life, the child is deeply
and wholly concentrated. His entire intellect is at work
and no kind of instructive reading would be at all fitting
while he is engaged in drawing or designing of this nature.</p>

<p>With the insets, as we have said, we have reproduced
some of the classic decorations so greatly admired in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Italian masterpieces; for instance, those of Giotto in
Florentine Art. When the children try with the insets to
reproduce these classic decorations from photographs they
are led to make most minute observations, which may be
considered a real study of art. They judge the relative
proportions of the various figures in such a way that their
eye learns to appreciate the harmony of the work. And
thus, even in childhood, a fine æsthetic enjoyment begins
to engage their minds on the higher and more noble
planes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FREE-HAND DRAWING&mdash;STUDIES FROM
LIFE</div>


<p>All the preceding exercises are "formative" for the
art of drawing. They develop in the child the manual
ability to execute a geometric design and prepare his
eye to appreciate the harmony of proportions between
geometric figures. The countless observations of drawings,
the habit of minute examination of natural objects,
constitute so many preparatory drills. We can, however,
say that the whole method, educating the eye and the hand
at the same time and training the child to observe and
execute drawings with intense application, prepares the
mechanical means for design, while the mind, left free to
take its flight and to create, is ready to produce.</p>

<p>It is by developing the individual that he is prepared
for that wonderful manifestation of the human intelligence,
which drawing constitutes. The ability <i>to see
reality</i> in form, in color, in proportion, to be master of
the movements of one's own hand&mdash;that is what is necessary.
Inspiration is an individual thing, and when a
child possesses these formative elements he can give expression
to all he happens to have.</p>

<p>There can be no "graduated exercises in drawing"
leading up to an artistic creation. That goal can be attained
only through the development of mechanical
technique and through the freedom of the spirit. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
is our reason for not teaching drawing directly to the
child. We prepare him indirectly, leaving him free to
the mysterious and divine labor of reproducing things
according to his own feelings. Thus drawing comes to
satisfy a need for expression, as does language; and almost
every idea may seek expression in drawing. The
effort to perfect such expression is very similar to that
which the child makes when he is spurred on to perfect
his language in order to see his thoughts translated into
reality. This effort is spontaneous; and the real drawing
teacher is in the inner life, which of itself develops,
attains refinement, and seeks irresistibly to be born into
external existence in some empirical form. Even the
smallest children try spontaneously to draw outlines of
the objects which they see; but the hideous drawings
which are exhibited in the common schools, as "free drawings"
"characteristic" of childhood, are not found
among our children. These horrible daubs so carefully
collected, observed, and catalogued by modern psychologists
as "documents of the infant mind" are nothing but
monstrous expressions of intellectual lawlessness; they
show only that the eye of their child is uneducated, the
hand inert, the mind insensible alike to the beautiful
and to the ugly, blind to the true as well as to the false.
Like most documents collected by psychologists who study
the children of our schools, they reveal not the soul but
the errors of the soul; and these drawings, with their monstrous
deformities, show simply what the uneducated
human being is like.</p>

<p>Such things are not "free drawings" by children.
<i>Free drawings</i> are possible only when we have a <i>free child</i>
who has been left free to grow and perfect himself in
the assimilation of his surroundings and in mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
reproduction; and who when left free to create and express
himself actually does create and express himself.</p>

<p>The sensory and manual preparation for drawing is
nothing more than an alphabet; but without it the child
is an illiterate and cannot express himself. And just as
it is impossible to study the writing of people who cannot
write, so there can be no psychological study of the drawings
of children who have been abandoned to spiritual
and muscular chaos. All psychic expressions acquire
value when the inner personality has acquired value by
the development of its formative processes. Until this
fundamental principle has become an absolute acquisition
we can have no idea of the psychology of a child as
regards his creative powers.</p>

<p>Thus, unless we know how a child should develop in
order to unfold his natural energies, we shall not know
how drawing as a natural expression is developed. The
universal development of the wondrous language of the
hand will come not from a "school of design" but from
a "school of the new man" which will cause this language
to spring forth spontaneously like water from an
inexhaustible spring. To confer the gift of drawing we
must create an eye that sees, a hand that obeys, a soul
that feels; and in this task the whole life must cooperate.
In this sense life itself is the only preparation for drawing.
Once we have lived, the inner spark of vision does
the rest.</p>

design on the left is similar to a decoration in the Cathedral at Florence,

</div>

<p>Leave to man then this sublime gesture which transfers
to the canvas the marks of creative divinity. Leave it
free to develop from the very time when the tiny child
takes a piece of chalk and reproduces a simple outline on
the blackboard, when he sees a leaf and makes his first
reproduction of it on the white page. Such a child is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a><br /><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a><br /><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
search of every possible means of expression, because
no one language is rich enough to give expression to the
gushing life within him. He speaks, he writes, he draws,
he sings like a nightingale warbling in the springtime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us consider, then, the "elements" which our children
have acquired in their development with reference
to drawing: they are observers of reality, knowing how to
distinguish the <i>forms</i> and <i>colors</i> they see there.</p>

</div>

<p>Children are peculiarly sensitive in their appreciation
of color. This sensibility began to grow in the sensory
exercises in the early years. Their hands have been
trained to the most delicate movements and the children
have been masters of them since the days of the "Children's
House." When they begin to draw outlines they
copy the most diverse objects&mdash;not only flowers but
everything which interests them: vases, columns and even
landscapes. Their attempts are spontaneous; and they
draw both on the blackboard and on paper.</p>

<p>As regards colors, it should be recalled that while still
in the "Children's House" the children learned to prepare
the different shades, mixing them themselves and
making the various blends. This always held their
eager interest. Later the care with which they seek to
get shades corresponding exactly to natural colorings is
something truly remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Over and over again the
children try to mix the most diverse colors, diluting or
saturating them until they have succeeded in reproducing
the desired shade. It is surprising also to see how often
their eye succeeds in appreciating the finest differences
of color and in reproducing them with striking accuracy.</p>

<span class="caption">Water-color paintings from nature, showing spontaneous expression resulting

</div>

<p>The study of natural science proved to be a great help
in drawing. Once I tried to show some children how
a flower should be dissected, and for this purpose I provided
all the necessary instruments: the botanist's needle,
pincers, thin glass plates, etc., just as is done at the university
for the experiments in natural science. My only
aim was to see whether the preparations which university
students make for botanical anatomy were in any way
adaptable to the needs of little children. Even at the
time when I studied in the botanical laboratory at the university
I felt that these exercises in the preparation of
material might be put to such use. Students know how
difficult it is to prepare a stem, a stamen, an epithelium,
for dissection, and how only with difficulty the hand, accustomed
for years exclusively to writing, adapts itself to
this delicate work. Seeing how skilful our children were
with their little hands I decided to give them a complete
scientific outfit and to test by experiment whether the
child mind and the characteristic manual dexterity shown
by children were not more adapted to such labors than
the mind and hand of a nineteen-year-old student.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/i_314.jpg" width="410" height="558" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>My suspicion proved correct. The children with the
keenest interest dissected a section of the violet with remarkable
accuracy, and they quickly learned to use all the
instruments. But my greatest surprise was to find that
they did not despise or throw away the dissected parts,
as we older students used to do. With great care they
placed them all in attractive order on a piece of white
paper, as if they had in mind some secret purpose. Then
with great joy they began to draw them; and they were
accurate, skilled, tireless, and patient, as they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a><br /><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
everything else. They began to mix and dilute their
colors to obtain the correct shades. They worked up to
the last minute of the school session, finishing off their
designs in watercolor: the stem and leaves green, the individual
petals violet, the stamens&mdash;all in a row&mdash;yellow,
and the dissected pistil light green. The following
day a little girl brought me a charmingly vivacious written
composition, in which she told of her enthusiasm over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the new work, describing even the less noticeable details
of the little violet.</p>

<p>These two expressions&mdash;drawing and composition&mdash;were
the spontaneous manifestations of their happy entrance
into the realms of science.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this great success, I took some simple
microscopes to school. The children began to observe the
pollen and even some of the membrane coverings of the
flower. By themselves they made some splendid cross-sections
of the stems, which they studied most attentively.</p>

<p>They "drew everything they saw." Drawing seemed
to be the natural complement of their observation work.</p>

<p>In this way the children learned to draw and paint
<i>without a drawing teacher</i>. They produced works which,
in geometric designs as well as in studies from life, were
considered far above the average drawings of children.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SCALE</div>


<p>Since the publication of my first volume on the education
of small children, considerable progress has been
made in the matter of musical education. Miss Maccheroni,
who came to Rome to work with me on experiments
looking to the continuation of the methods used
with primary classes, was successful in establishing a
number of tests which constituted our first steps into this
important field of education. We are under great obligations
to the Tronci firm of Pistoja, which took charge
of the manufacture of materials and gave us the most
sympathetic cooperation.</p>

<p>We had already prepared at the time of that first publication
an equipment of bells to be used in training the
ear to perceive differences between musical sounds. The
methods of using this material were considerably modified
and perfected again after the publication of my <i>Own
Handbook</i> (New York, Stokes, 1914), in which for
the first time appeared a treatise on musical method. The
foundation of the system consists of a series of bells
representing the whole tones and semi-tones of one octave.
The material follows the general characteristics of that
used in the sensorial method, that is, the objects differ
from each other in one and only one quality, the one which
concerns the stimulation of the sense under education.
The bells, for instance, must be <i>apparently identical</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
dimensions, shape, etc., but they must <i>produce different
sounds</i>. The basic exercise is to have the child recognize
"identities." He must pair off the bells which give
the same sound.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="431" height="96" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>The bell system is constructed as follows: We have
a very simple support, made of wood (of course any other
material might be used) 115 cm. long and 25 cm. wide.
On this the bells rest. The board is wide enough to hold
two bells placed lengthwise and end to end across it. The
board is marked off into black and white spaces, each
wide enough to hold one bell. The white spaces represent
whole tones, the black spaces semi-tones. Though
the apparent purpose of this board is to serve as a
support, it is in reality a <i>measure</i>, since it indicates
the regular position of the notes in the simple diatonic
scale. The combination of white and black rectangles
indicates the interval between the various notes in the
scale: in other words, a semi-tone between the third and
fourth and between the seventh and eighth, and a whole
tone between the others. Bells showing the value of each
rectangle are fixed in proper order in the upper portion
of the support. These bells are not all of the same size,
but vary in dimension regularly from the bottom to the
top of the scale. This permits considerable saving in
manufacture; for, to get a different sound from bells of
the same size, different thicknesses are required, and this
entails more labor for construction and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
greater cost. But in addition the child here sees a material
variation corresponding to the differences in quality
of sound. On the other hand, the other bells on which
the child is to perform his critical exercises are of <i>identical
dimensions</i>.</p>

<p>In the exercise the child strikes with a small mallet
one of the bells fixed on the support. Then, from among
the others scattered at random on the table, he finds one
which gives the same sound and places it on the board in
front of the fixed bell corresponding to it. In the most
elementary exercises, only the whole tone bells corresponding
to the white spaces are used. Later, the semi-tones
are brought in. This first exercise in sense perception
corresponds to the pairing practised in other sensory
exercises (color, touch, etc.) The next step is for the
child to distinguish differences, and at the same time,
gradations of stimuli (like the exercises with the color
charts, hearing, etc.) In this case the child mixes at
random the eight bells, all of the same size, which give
the whole tones of the scale. He is to find <i>do</i>, then <i>re</i>,
and so on through the octave one note after the other,
placing the bells in order in their proper places. Nomenclature
is taught step by step as in the other sensorial
exercises. To familiarize the child with the names,
<i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, we use small round disks, the
circular form serving to suggest the head of the written
note. On each disk the name of the note is written. The
disks are to be placed on the bases of the bells that correspond
to them. The exercises in naming the notes
may be begun with the fixed bells, in order (with children
who already know how to read) to associate the
sounds with their names in the first exercise of pairing.
Later, when the child comes to the exercise of putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the bells in gradation, he can place the corresponding
disk on each bell as he finds it.</p>

<p>Some individuals, commenting on this material, have
solemnly protested their native inability to understand
music, insisting that music reveals its secrets only to a
chosen few. We may point out in reply that, so far, our
principal object is simply to distinguish notes so widely
different from each other that the different number of
vibrations can easily be measured with instruments. It
is a question of a material difference which any normal
ear can naturally detect without any miraculous aptitude
of a musical character. One might as well claim that it
is the privilege only of genius to distinguish one color
from another somewhat like it. Particular aptitude for
music is determined by conditions of a quite different and
a much higher order, such as intuition of the laws of harmony
and counterpoint, inspiration for composition, and
so on.</p>

<p>In actual practise, we found that when the material
was used with some restrictions by forty children between
three and six years of age, only six or seven proved
capable of filling out the major scale by ear. But when
the material was freely placed at their disposal, they all
progressed along the same lines and showed about the
same rate of improvement, as was the case in our experiments
with reading, writing, etc. When individual differences
appeared, it was by no means due to the <i>possibility</i>
of performing these tasks, but rather to the amount
of <i>interest</i> taken in the exercises, for which some children
showed actual enthusiasm. Eagerness for surmounting
difficulties and for high attainment is much more frequently
found in children than we, judging by our own
experience as adults, easily suspect. In any event, actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
performance is the only guide to the revelation of
particular aptitude, of personal calling.</p>

<p>When one of the larger children spreads on the table
the eight bells of similar size to make up the scale by ear,
the little ones pick up a single bell, sometimes reaching
out for it with the greatest eagerness. They beat it with
the mallet for a long time, they feel of it, examining it
carefully, making it ring more and more slowly. The
older children take special interest in the pairing, often
repeating the same exercise many times; but an unusual
charm is found in the successive sounds of the eight bells
when placed in order; in other words, in hearing the
scale. Nennella, one of the children of the "Children's
House" of Via Giusti, played the scale over two hundred
times in succession, one hundred for the ascending
scale and one hundred back again. The whole class is
sometimes interested in listening, the children following
with absolute silence the classic beauty of this succession
of sounds. Another child, Mario, used to go to the very
end of the table&mdash;as far away as possible, and resting
his elbows on the table with his head in his hands, he
would remain without stirring in the silence of the darkened
room, showing his extraordinary interest in the exercise
in every detail of demeanor and facial expression.</p>

<p>At a certain, moment, interest in reproducing the note
vocally appears. The children accompany the scale with
their voices. They strive for the exact reproduction of
the sound which the bell gives. Their voices become soft
and musical in this exercise, showing nothing of that
shrillness, so characteristic of children's voices in the
usual popular songs. In the classes of Via Trionfale
it happened that some children asked permission to accompany
vocally the scale that a child was playing softly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the bells. The interest taken in this exercise was of a
higher order than that shown by children in the singing
of songs. It was easy to see that songs with their capricious
intervals between widely separated notes and calling
for pronunciation of words, musical expression, differences
in time, etc., are unadapted to the most elementary
exercises in singing.</p>

<p>It was possible to test the absolute memory of the child
for the different notes without any set exercise. After a
long series of experiments in pairing, the children begin
to make scales, using only one series of bells, and they
repeat this exercise many times and in different ways.
Sometimes, for instance, a child always looks for the
lowest note, <i>do</i>, then for the next above it, <i>re</i>, etc. Again,
a child will take any bell at random, looking next for the
note immediately above or immediately below, and so on.
It also happens that on picking up some bell or other,
the child will exclaim on hearing its sound, this is <i>mi</i>,
this is <i>do</i>, and so on. One child had made a splendid
demonstration of the use of the bells before her Majesty,
the Queen Mother. This was in the month of May. Although
he had had no further access to the materials in
his "Children's House" of Via Giusti, in the November
following he was asked to use some musical pipes,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which
he had hardly seen before, and which happened to be in
great disorder since they had just arrived from the factory.
There were sixteen pipes mixed at random, comprising
a double diatonic scale. He took one of the pipes,
struck it and said, "This is <i>si</i>," and immediately hung
it on the appropriate hook of the support. On ringing
the next one, he said, this is <i>mi</i>, and again put the pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
in the right place. So he went on and arranged the sixteen
pipes in accurate order on the two parallel frames.
He had had a good deal of exercise during the preceding
year and had preserved an absolutely accurate memory
of the notes.</p>

<p>As is the case with colors, geometrical shapes, etc., the
children begin at this point to explore the environment.
One will come to the teacher at the piano and say, striking
a key, "This is <i>stee</i>," meaning that the note corresponds
to the first syllable of the first word in some song
he knows (Stella, Stellina). It happens that the key
struck by the child is a <i>do</i>, the very note corresponding
to the syllable <i>ste</i> in the song. We had many touching
examples of this musical exploration of the environment.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE READING AND WRITING OF MUSIC</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Material</span>: In "The Children's House" the musical
staff is introduced by means of a board painted green
with the lines in bas relief. On each line and in each
space representing the octave to which the sounds of the
bells respectively correspond, is a small circular indenture,
or socket, into which the disk for each note may be
inserted. Inside each indenture is written a number:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The disks used in this exercise have
a number written on the lower face and the name of a
note on the upper: for instance, 1, <i>do;</i> 2, <i>re;</i> 3, <i>mi;</i> 4, <i>fa;</i>
5, <i>sol;</i> 6, <i>la;</i> 7, <i>si:</i></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<span class="caption"><i>do&mdash;re&mdash;mi&mdash;fa&mdash;sol&mdash;la&mdash;si&mdash;do.</i><br />

<img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="430" height="169" alt="drawing" />
</span>
</div>

<p>This device enables the child to place the notes on their
respective lines without making any mistakes and to examine
their relative positions. The indentures are so
arranged as to show an empty space wherever a semi-tone
appears:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>do</i>.<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>In the semi-tone spaces black counters are to be placed.
At a later stage of this exercise the staff is represented by
a wooden board similar to the one described above, but
without the indentures. The child has at his disposal a
great many disks with the notes written out in full on
one face. He can arrange thirty or forty of these disks
at random on the board, keeping them, however, in their
places according to the names of the notes; but each time
the surface showing the name of the note should be placed
downward on the board, so that on the line only disks
without names are visible. When a child has finished
this exercise, he is to turn the disks over without disarranging
them and so determine from their names whether
he has placed them properly. All the disks on a given
line or in a given space should have the same names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Should any doubt arise as to the proper place of a note,
the other board with the numbered indentures can be used
as a check.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i_327.jpg" width="491" height="413" alt="drawing of scales with notes placed by children" />
</div>

<p>When a child has reached this stage of development,
he can practice reading the musical script, ringing the
bells according to the notes he is interpreting. The musical
staffs are prepared on oblong cards about seventeen
centimeters broad. The notes are about two centimeters
in diameter. The cards are variously colored&mdash;blue, violet,
yellow, red.</p>

<p>The next step is for the children to write notes themselves.
For this purpose we have prepared little sheets
which can be bound together into a book or album.</p>

<p>We offer also a few songs employing two or three notes
so simple in character that the child can make them out
by ear on his bells. When, after some practise, he is
certain he can copy the song, he writes the notes on his
staff and so becomes the editor of his own music.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Treble and Bass Clefs</span></h3>

<p><i>Arrangement of the notes in the form of a rhombus:</i>
All the exercises thus far have been in reference to the
higher <i>clef</i>. However, no representation of this key has
as yet been given the child. His first task is to learn the
relative position of the notes on the two staffs. To supply
this want, following the system of the Musical Conservatory
of Milan, we have adopted the double staff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i_328.jpg" width="355" height="131" alt="blank double staff" />

<span class="caption">The notes written by the child.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The broken line (<a href="#Page_328">p. 328</a>) indicates the position of
<i>do</i>, the point of departure for the scale. In fact, as the
notes pass from line to space and space to line, they form
the natural series:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>do</i>.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The same situation develops as they go down the scale:</div>

<div class='center'>
<i>do</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>do</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>When the position of <i>do</i> has been determined, the other
notes above and below it are easily found. From the
<i>do</i> on the left the child can find his way to the <i>do</i> on the
next octave higher and come down again. Likewise from
the same point on the right (<i>do</i>) he can go down to the
<i>do</i> of the lower octave and then go up the scale again.
When these notes are represented on the combined
staffs with the counters, the resulting design is a rhombus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="413" height="172" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>Separating the two staffs, the arrangement of the notes
in the higher and lower key (the C scale and bass) becomes
apparent and the different significance of the two
series can be emphasized by placing to the left of the
staff the two clef signs, which have been prepared as special
portions of our material.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In this way the children have learned the scale in <i>do
major</i> in the two keys. The arrangement of the black
and white spaces puts them in a position to recognize
these notes even on the piano. Our material, in fact,
includes a diminutive keyboard where the keys are small
enough to fit the size of a child's hand. It can be used
as an exercise for the finger muscles. As each key is
touched it raises a hammer marked with the name of the
note struck, which the child can see through a glass.
Thus while the child is practising his finger movements,
he fixes his acquaintance with the arrangement of the
notes on the keyboard. This small piano makes no noise.
However, a sort of organ-pipe mechanism can be fitted
on above the hammers in such a way that each stroke, as
the hammer rises, connects with a reed which gives a
corresponding sound.</p>

<p>All the exercises thus far have been based upon sensory
experience as the point of departure. The child's
ear has recognized the fundamental sounds and initiated
him into real musical education. All the rest, such as the
music writing, etc., <i>is not music</i>.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MAJOR SCALES</div>


<p>We have developed additional material for the teaching
of the scales. Here we show a chart somewhat suggesting
the arrangement of the bell material used in
the first exercises. That is, the relative intervals between
the various notes of the scale are clearly indicated. The
<i>scale</i> is, in fact, a series of eight sounds, the intervals
between each being as indicated by the black marks in
the design: whole tone, whole tone, semi-tone, whole tone,
whole tone, whole tone, semi-tone.</p>

<p>In the <i>do major</i> scale the intervals are indicated as
follows: a whole tone between <i>do</i> and <i>re;</i> <i>re</i> and <i>mi;</i> <i>fa</i>
and <i>sol;</i> <i>sol</i> and <i>la;</i> <i>la</i> and <i>si;</i> and a semi-tone between
<i>mi</i> and <i>fa</i> and <i>si</i> and <i>do</i>. If, however, instead of beginning
with <i>do</i>, the scale starts from some other note, the
mutual intervals characterizing the scale remain unchanged.
It is as though the whole scale with its characteristic
construction as regards tone differences were
moved along. Accordingly, as our plate shows, under
the figure of the two octaves there is another figure. This
latter is a movable piece of cardboard which shows the
construction of the octave in black and white. This movable
card is fastened to the large chart by a ribbon. Supposing
now we slide this movable piece, as indicated in
the figure, to the level of <i>mi</i>. The intervals between the
tones of the <i>mi</i> scale are the same as in all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
scales. In other words, they remain as indicated on the
small movable card. It is necessary, accordingly, to
strike on the grand scale the notes corresponding to the
white spaces of the movable slip: viz.,</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i> diesis, <i>sol</i> diesis, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>do</i> diesis, <i>re</i> diesis.<br />
</div>

<p>This process may be repeated by sliding the movable
card to all the notes in succession. In this way all the
scales are gradually constructed. This becomes an interesting
theoretical exercise, since the child discovers
that he is able to build <i>all possible scales</i> by himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">

<span class="caption">The monocord. In the first instrument the notes are indicated by frets.
On the monocord in the foreground the child places the frets as he

<span class="caption">Material for indicating the intervals of the major scale and its transposition
from one key to another.</span>
</div>

<p>We have, however, for this purpose a real musical
material, as appears from our design. Here on a
wooden form like that used for the bells, but two octaves
instead of one octave long, we have arranged prisms of
equal dimensions but painted black and white according
to the tones they represent. Each prism shows a rectangular
plate exposed to view. The plates are identical
in appearance on all the prisms. They are, however,
really of different lengths according to the different
prisms. When these plates are struck, they give the
notes of two octaves, the prisms acting as sounding boards.
The sounds are soft and mellow and unusually clear, so
that we do not exaggerate in describing this mechanism
as really a musical instrument (resembling the Xylophone).
In our design each piece is arranged in its
proper position in the <i>do major</i> scale.</p>

<p>Since the intervals between the tones are the same for
all the scales without distinction, if the group of prisms
is moved as a whole from right to left, sliding along the
wooden form, some of the prisms will fall. The resulting
effect is the same as that produced when the small
card was moved over the larger chart (see above). No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
matter how far the group of prisms is moved, the scale
can be obtained by striking all the prisms corresponding
to the white spaces on the wooden form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/fp_335.jpg" width="600" height="385" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">The upper cut shows the music bars arranged for the scale of C major. The lower cut shows the transposition
of the scale, preserving, however, the same intervals.</span>
</div>

<p>For instance, let us take away the two first prisms, <i>do</i>
and <i>do diesis</i> on the left, and push the whole group of
prisms from right to left until <i>re</i> reaches the point formerly
occupied by <i>do</i>. If, now, we strike the plates
which correspond to the notes of the major scale, we obtain
the major scale in <i>re</i>. On examining the notes
which make up this scale, we find: <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa diesis</i>, <i>sol</i>,
<i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>do diesis</i>, <i>re</i>.</p>

<p>This brief description will indicate how interesting
this instrument is. It contains in very simple form and
expresses in a clear and delightful way the fundamental
principles of harmony. Its use can be made apparent
to teachers by the three following tables.</p>

<p>As the children derive in this way all the possible
scales, they should transfer them to their copy books,
making use of all the symbols of musical notation. The
copying of the scales should be developed progressively:
first the scale with one <i>diesis</i>, next the scale with two,
then the one with three <i>dieses</i>, etc. Fine opportunities
for observation are here offered. A child may see for
instance that a scale with two <i>dieses</i> has the same <i>diesis</i>
which appeared in the preceding scale; a scale with three
<i>dieses</i> has the two <i>dieses</i> of the preceding scales, and so
on. The <i>dieses</i> recur at intervals of five notes.</p>

<p>Since in using the first material, by changing the third
and sixth bell, the child was taught to recognize the harmonic
minor scale, to construct it and listen to it, it is
now an obviously simple matter for him to make up all
the minor scales.</p>

<p>We have thus developed exercises which prepare for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the recognition of the major and minor tones as well as
for the recognition of the different tones. It also becomes
an easy matter to play a simple <i>motif</i> in different
keys. It is sufficient to move the series of plates, as has
been indicated, and play them over according to the indications
of the white and black spaces of the wooden
form.</p>

<p>One of the instruments which brings the child to
producing and recognizing notes is the <i>monochord</i>. It
is a simple, resonant box with one string. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
exercise is in tuning. The string is made to correspond
with one of the resonant prisms (<i>do</i>). This is
made possible by a key with which the string can be loosened
or tightened. The child may now be taught to handle
the violin bow or mandolin plectrum, or he may be
instructed in the finger thrumming used for the harp
or banjo. On one of our monochords, the notes are indicated
by fixed transversal frets, the name of each note
being printed in the proper space. These notes are, however,
not written on the other monochord, where the child
must learn to discover by ear the proper distances at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
which the notes are produced. In this case the child has
at his disposal movable frets with which he can indicate
the points he has discovered as producing a given note.
These frets should be left in position by the child to
serve as a check on his work. The children have shown
considerable interest also in little pitchpipes, which give
very pleasing tones.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>Thus in composing the scales and in listening to them
the child performs real exercises in musical education.
A given melody in the major scale is repeated in various
keys. In listening to it carefully, in repeating it, in
observing the notes which make it up, the child has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
exercise similar to the audition of the note, but an exercise
of a far more advanced character.</p>

<p>This exercise is to be the starting point for <i>understanding</i>
melody. To make the hearing of music an intelligent
act and not like the mechanical process which
appears when children read, in loud monotone, books
which they cannot understand and of the meaning of
which they have no idea, preparatory exercises are required.
We get this preparation through various exercises
in the audition of various scales for the recognition
of key, and in exercises on the interpretation of rhythm.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EXERCISES IN RHYTHM</div>


<p>One of our most successful exercises has proved to be
that originally conceived as a help in teaching children
to walk, viz., "walking the line." It will be remembered
that among the exercises in motor education used at the
outset of our method, appeared that of walking with one
foot in front of the other on a line drawn on the floor,
much as do tight-rope-walking acrobats. The purpose of
this exercise was to stabilize equilibrium, to teach erect
carriage and to make movement freer and more certain.</p>

<p>Miss Maccheroni began her exercises in rhythm by
accompanying this walking of the children with piano
music. In fact, the sound of the piano came to be the
call signal for the children to take up this exercise. The
teacher starts to play and immediately the children come
of their own accord, and almost without exception, to
take up their positions on the line. At the very beginning
the music seems to be purely a signal, at best a
pleasant accompaniment to the motor exercise. There
is no apparent adaptation of the child's movements to the
musical rhythm. However, as the same measure is repeated
for a considerable period, the rudiments of this
adaptation begin to appear. One of the children begins
to keep step with the rhythm of the music. Individual
differences in adaptation persist for some time; but if
the same musical rhythm is kept up, almost all the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
finally become sensible to it. In fact, these little
people begin to develop general attitudes of body, in relation
to the music, which are of the greatest interest.
First of all, the children change their gait according to
the music: the light walk, the war-like march, the run,
develop on the impulse of the rhythmic movement. It
is not that the teacher "teaches" the child to change his
walk according to the music: the phenomenon arises of
its own accord. The child begins to interpret the rhythm
by moving in harmony with it. But to obtain this result
the teacher must play perfectly, carefully noting all
the details of musical punctuation. The creation of musical
feeling in the children depends upon the teacher's
own feeling and the rigorous accuracy of her own execution.</p>

<p>It will be useful to give here a few details on the execution
of these first rhythmic exercises. The children
begin, as we have said, by learning to walk on the line.
They develop a passion for walking on that line, yielding
to a fascination which grown-up people cannot conceive.
They seem to put their whole souls into it. This is the
moment for the teacher to sit down at the piano and
without saying anything to play the first melody in our
series. The children smile, they look at the piano and
continue to walk, becoming more and more concentrated
on what they are doing. The melody acts as a persuading
voice; the children begin to consider the time of the
music and little by little their tiny feet begin to strike
the line in step with it. Some of our three-year-olders
begin to keep step as early as the first or second trial.
After a very few attempts a whole class of forty children
will be walking in time. We must warn against the
error of playing with special emphasis on the measure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
in other words, of striking more loudly than is required
the note (thesis) which marks the inception of the rhythmic
period. The teacher should be careful simply to
bring out all the expression that the melody requires.
She may be sure that the rhythmic cadence will become
apparent from the tune itself. The playing of one note
more loudly than the others, thus to emphasize the rhythmic
accent (thesis), is to deprive the selection of all its
value as melody and therefore of its power to cause the
motory action corresponding to rhythm. It is necessary
to play accurately and with feeling, giving an interpretation
as real as possible. We get thus a "musical time"
which, as every one knows, is not the "mechanical time"
of the metronome. If it is certainly absurd to play a
<i>Nocturne</i> of Chopin on the metronome, it is hardly less
absurd and certainly quite as disagreeable to play a piece
of dance music on that instrument. Even those people
who have a great aptitude for feeling "time" and who
play with special attention to exactness of measure, know
that they cannot follow the metronome without positive
discomfort. Children feel the rhythm of a piece of
music if it is played with <i>musical feeling;</i> and not only
do they follow the time with their footsteps, but, as the
rhythmic periods vary, they adapt the whole attitude of
their bodies to the melodic period, which is developed
around the beats constituting the rhythm as around points
of support. There is a vast difference between this
exercise and that of having children march to the clapping
of hands or to the time of <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, etc., counted in
a tone of command.</p>

<p>A child of ten years was dancing to the music of a
Chopin waltz played with most generous concessions to
the different colorations indicated in the text. She put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
into her movements a certain fullness of swing, to bring
out the effect which a marked <i>rallentando</i> gives the notes.
Of course this method of dancing demands on the part of
the children a perfect and intimate identification of spirit
with the music; but this is something which children,
even when they are small, possess in a very special way,
and which they develop in their long and uninterrupted
walks on the line to the sounds of a tune often repeated.
It is curious to see them assume a demeanor entirely in
harmony with the expression of the music they are following.
A little boy of three, during the playing of our
first melody, held the palms of his hands turned parallel
with the floor and as he walked he bent his knees slightly
with each step. On passing from our first to our second
tunes, he changed not only the rapidity of his footsteps,
but the attitude of his whole body. Considered as something
external this may be of slight importance, but considered
as evidence of a mental state, the change in demeanor
bears witness to a distinct artistic experience.
The composer of the tune could well be proud of such a
sincere response to his work, if the test of musical beauty
be regarded as successful communication of feeling.</p>

<p>Our second tune is a rapid <i>andante</i> somewhat <i>staccato</i>.
The first was slow and blending (<i>legato</i>). The children
feel the <i>legato</i>, answering it with very reserved movements.
The <i>staccato</i> lifts them from the floor. The
<i>crescendo</i> makes them hurry and stamp their feet. The
<i>forte</i> sometimes brings them to clap their hands, while
<i>calando</i> restores them to the silent march, which turns,
during the <i>piano</i>, to perfect silence. The completion
of the musical period brings them to a halt and they
stand there expectant until it is taken up again; or if it
be the end of the whole tune, they suddenly stop.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Beppino, a little boy of three, used to keep time with
the extended forefinger of his right hand. The music
was a song in two parts repeated alternately, the one in
<i>legato</i> and the other in <i>staccato;</i> with the <i>legato</i> he used
a uniform regular movement; he followed the <i>staccato</i>
with sudden spasmodic beats.</p>

<p>To-day forty children may be seen walking as softly as
possible during a tune played <i>pianissimo</i>. These same
children on the day when they first heard the <i>piano</i> kept
calling to the teacher "play louder; we can't hear" and
yet at that time the teacher was playing not <i>pianissimo</i>,
but <i>mezzo forte!</i></p>

<p>At first the children interested in the first tune are
deaf to any other. The children in the St. Barnaba
School in Milan got in step with the first tune. They
did not notice that the teacher had changed to the second
and kept their step so well that when the first tune was
resumed, the teacher found them in perfect time, while
on the faces of the children appeared a smile of recognition,
as it were, of an old friend.</p>

<p>If the teacher is sufficiently cautious, she can discover
without disturbing the children the moment when they
have caught a new tune; and even if only a few succeed
in following both of the first two melodies, the
teacher can satisfy these few by alternating the tunes.
This does not disturb the others who come, little by little,
to notice the change in the music and to fall in with the
new movement. In a public kindergarten at Perugia
an attempt of this nature was made without warning by
a lady, who, being a visitor, felt free to take this liberty.
The children were invited into the large hall and left to
themselves while the lady was playing on the piano our
third melody, a march. The older children caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
movement at once. After they had been marching for
some time a <i>galop</i> was played. Some hesitation appeared
in a few pupils while others apparently were not
aware of the change in the music. Suddenly two or three
began to run, as though swept away by the rhythmic
wave, as though borne along by the music. They hardly
seemed to touch that floor to which, but a few moments
previously, the march seemed to have glued them at every
step! A portion of the children in this class had taken
seats in the sloping auditorium around the room. They
were the youngest children; and when the victorious
charge broke out to the tune of the <i>galop</i>, they began to
clap their hands enthusiastically. Some of the teachers
felt alarmed, but certainly the spectacle was an inspiring
one.</p>

<p>It follows that if we are to <i>tell</i> the children to "hop,"
"run," or "march," there is no use in our giving them
music. We must take our choice: either <i>music</i> or <i>commands</i>.
Even in our reading lessons with the slips, we
do not tell the child the word that he must read. We
must do without commands, without false accentuation of
notes, without enforced positions. Music, if it be in
reality an expressive language, suggests everything to
children if they are left to themselves. Rhythmic interpretation
of the musical thought is expressed by the attitude
and movement of body and spirit.</p>

<p>Nannina, a girl four years old, would gracefully spread
her skirt, and relax her arms along her body. She would
bend her knees slightly, throw her head back and turning
her pretty little face to one side, smile at those behind
her as though extending her amiability in all directions.</p>

<p>Beppino, four and a half years old, stood with his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
together motionless at the center of the ellipse drawn on
the floor, on which the children were walking. He beat
the time of the first tune with an outstretched arm, bowing
from the waist in perfectly correct form at every
measure. The time consumed in this bow of Beppino
exactly filled the interval between one <i>thesis</i> and the
next and was in perfect accord with the movement of the
tune.</p>

<p>Nannina, the same pretty girl we mentioned above,
always grew stiff when a military march was played;
she would frown and walk heavily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the intervention of the teacher to
give some apposite lesson, tending to perfect certain movements,
is something which gives the children extraordinary
delight. Five of our little girls embraced each other
rapturously and smothered the teacher with kisses when
they had learned a few new movements of a rhythmic
dance.</p>

<p>Otello, Vincenzino and Teresa had been taught to get
a better effect from their tambourines, their steps and
gestures. Each of them thanked the teacher for the
profitable lesson in a special way. Vincenzino gave her
a beaming smile whenever he marched past her; Teresa
would furtively touch her with her hand; Otello was even
more demonstrative&mdash;as he went by her he would leave
the line, run to her and embrace her for a second or two.</p>

<p>If the spontaneity of every child has been respected; if,
in other words, every child has been able to grow in his
or her own way, listening to the tunes, following them
with the footsteps and with free movements&mdash;interpreting
them; if each child has been able to penetrate, without
being disturbed by any one, into the heart of the
beautiful fact which the understanding of music constitutes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
then it is easy for the teacher who has forty children
(between three and five and a half years of age)
only one assistant, and preferably perhaps a whole apartment
instead of a closed room, to sit down at the piano
and teach eight children a long and intricate dance,&mdash;the
lanciers in five parts. And then just like the orchestra
leader who has prepared his pupils, the teacher with
a minimum of effort gets the very effect in dancing, etc.,
which teachers generally are so anxious to obtain. Then
we can get marches, counter marches, simultaneous movements,
alternate movements, interweaving lines,&mdash;anything
in fact, that we wish, and with perfect accuracy
besides; since every movement in the children corresponds
exactly with the development of the tune.</p>

<p>For instance, the children are marching two by two,
holding each other's hand, during the playing of a short
tune. At the end of this melody they slowly kneel, but
in such a way that on the sound of the last note they are
touching the floor very gently with their knees. There
is something sweet about the accuracy and the perfect
simultaneousness attained by the children, under the
guidance of the tune. The effect of these exercises on
them is to bring repose to their whole body and a sense
of peace to their little souls.</p>

<p>On one occasion in a school just opened in Milan, 1908,
the children re-acted to the piano by jumping about in
confusion, waving their arms, moving their shoulders and
legs. This was really an attempt to represent by a sort
of chaos the complexity of the rhythmic movements they
were hearing. They were actually making, without any
assistance from others, a spontaneous attempt at musical
interpretation. They soon grew tired of this, saying that
"the thing was ugly." They had, however, divined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
possibilities of an orderly motory action; and when they
had become quiet again, they began to listen to the music
with great interest waiting for the revelation of its deep
secret. Then suddenly they began to walk again, this
time regularly and according to the real measure.</p>

<p>One of the children, whose graph was somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="485" height="52" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<p>(pauses, that is, on the line of quiescence, with frequent
excursions into the negative field), took no part in these
rhythmic exercises. On the contrary, he was always
breaking them up by pushing the other children out of
line or making a noise. Finally, however, he did learn
not to disturb others; in other words, to stay <i>quiet</i>, something
which he had never known how to do before. It is
a great conquest for a disorderly child to gain the ability
to become quite motionless, in a gently placid state of
mind. His next step was to learn to move delicately,
with respect for other people; and he came to have a
certain sensitiveness about his relations with his schoolmates.
For example, he used to blush when they smiled
at him and even when he took no part in what they were
doing, he shared their activities with an affectionate attention.
From this point on Riziero (that was the child's
name) entered on a higher plane of existence&mdash;one of
order, labor and politeness.</p>

<p>The fact also that children at times listen to the music,
while remaining seated comfortably around the room,
watching the other children dance and march, is in itself
a pretty thing. The children who are seated become
very self-controlled. They watch their schoolmates or exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
a few words cautiously with each other. At times,
even, they let themselves go in interesting expressions of
movement with their arms. The manifestations of placidity
and interest here seen cannot be disjoined from a
healthful, spiritual upbuilding&mdash;a beautiful orderliness,
which is being established within them. Obviously, a
wonderful harmony springs up between the teacher, who
plays with enthusiastic feeling and with all possible skill
of hand and abundance of spirit simply because she feels
the musical phenomena around her in the children, and
the pupils who, little by little, are transformed under
this influence, and show an understanding of the music,
which becomes for them something more and more intimate,
more and more complete. It is no longer a question
of the <i>step</i>, but of the position of the whole body:
arms, heads, chests <i>are moved</i> by the music.</p>

<p>Finally, many of the children beat time with their
hands, and interpret correctly without ever having been
taught distinctions between 3 and 4 time, etc. When a
keen interest in "guessing" the time is awakened in them,
the children look about for various objects&mdash;wands, tambourines,
castagnettes, etc., and the class exercise is developed
to perfection. The child comes to be "possessed"
by the music. He obeys the musical command with his
whole body and becomes more and more perfect in this
obedience shown by his muscles.</p>

<p>Here is a pretty story which will show to what extent
children can feel themselves dependent on the music
which "makes them move." Once my father went into
a room where a little Parisian girl whom he was very
fond of was passionately marching to the rhythm of a
tune played on the piano. The child usually ran to meet
the old gentleman; but that day the moment she saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
she began to shout to Miss Maccheroni, who was playing,
"<i>Arrête, arrête!</i>" She wanted to go and shake
hands with my father, something she could not do as long
as the music was continuing to <i>command</i> her to move with
the rhythm. And in fact, it was not until Miss Maccheroni
stopped playing that the little girl was able to
run and deliver her greeting.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>We have prepared a series of tunes for this work and
I think it will be useful to give here three which we
finally selected because they have succeeded, whenever
they were tried, in arousing in the children the phenomena
above described. There are eight movements chosen from
repeated over and over again and played with all possible
accuracy, will surely, sooner or later, be felt in every
rhythm by the children.</p>

<p>The transition from following the time by ones (that
is, one beat for every rhythmic element) to the indication
of simply the beginning of the measure (that is,
one beat on the <i>thesis</i>) appeared for the first time in a
"Children's House" directed by Miss Maccheroni.
There, one morning when the children were following the
music with great pleasure, marching about and beating on
tambourines, it was a girl who first caught the strong beat
(<i>thesis</i>). A little boy behind her made the conquest a
second later; but while the little girl lost what she had
gained almost immediately, the little boy developed it to
perfection. Shortly after other children made the same
progress, apparently as a saving of effort; they began, that
is, by beating once on every step. This required a rapid
movement and an endless succession of beats. All of a
sudden they began to beat on the first note of a measure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The children using the music bells and wooden keyboards. (<i>The Washington Montessori School, Washington,
D. C.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>Here, for instance, is a case of 4/4 time:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/i_352a.jpg" width="467" height="43" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The children at first marked the time without regard to
the measure, thus:</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<img src="images/i_352b.jpg" width="434" height="21" alt="drawing" />
</div>


<p>But the moment comes suddenly when they catch the
measure: then they beat it as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i_352c.jpg" width="440" height="41" alt="drawing" />
</div>


<div class='unindent'>In other words, their beats fall only on the first note at
the measure.</div>

<p>Maria Louise, a little under four years of age, was
walking to the sound of a 2/4 march, played rather
lightly. Suddenly she called to the teacher: "<i>Regarde,
regarde, comme je fais!</i>" She was making little skips,
gracefully raising her arms on the first beat of the measure.
Her invention was extraordinarily happy and graceful.</p>

<p>Usually in teaching the divisions of musical time, it
has been the custom to play <i>forte</i> the time called theoretically
<i>tempo forte:</i> in other words, to strike hard on the
first note of every rhythmic measure. In fact, teachers
of children or young people can often be heard playing
a tune with special emphasis on the first note of every
measure and playing the successive notes <i>pianissimo</i>.
Naturally the motory action corresponds to this: it will
be tense for the strong beats and light for the weak
beats. But what value has all this in relation to the feeling
of the rhythmic measure? What is called theoretically
<i>tempo forte</i> has no relation to the meaning of the
words "strong" and "weak" in their ordinary sense.
It is a question of <i>emphasis</i> and <i>expression</i>, which derive
their nature from the laws of musical time and melodic
composition and certainly not from the wrist muscles of
the person playing. If this were not so, a person could
play the first, second or third note of a measure as <i>forte</i>,
whereas, in reality, it is the first that is always "strong."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/fp_353.jpg" width="431" height="600" alt="photograph" />
<span class="caption">Analyzing the beat of a measure while walking on a line. (<i>A Montessori
School in Italy.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>In practise, children, to whom the six tunes we proposed
for the beginning of this study were played&mdash;and
played always with rigorous musical interpretation and
with expressiveness&mdash;succeeded in recognizing the first
beat of the measure as "strong," and went on thus to
divide into measures some thirty pieces of music of
varied rhythm. Even the following year, after the summer
vacation, they kept asking for new pieces of music
just for the "fun" of working out the measure in them.
They would stand at the side of the teacher at the piano
and either with their hands or with soft playing on the
castagnettes or tambourines, accompany their new piece
of music. In general they would listen in silence to the
first measure and then fall in with their little beats like
any well-trained orchestra. They took the trouble no
longer to march to the music: they were interested in this
new form of study; while the smaller tots, delighted with
the new music, were still walking undisturbed along the
elliptical line on the floor which was to guide them to such
great conquests!</p>

<p>The strong beat (<i>thesis</i>) is the key that opens to the
higher laws of music. Sometimes it is played, for reasons
of expression, very softly and always possesses the
solemnity of the note which dominates the rhythm. It
may even be syncopated or lacking entirely, just as when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a><br /><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the orator on reaching his climax pronounces in a very
low voice the phrase which is to produce the great effect,
or even pauses and is silent: this sentence rings powerfully
in the ears of those who listen.</p>

<p>The same error which leads to heavy stress, in playing,
on the first beat of every measure in order to attract
the attention of the children to it, also leads to suggesting
secondary movements in addition to the one which
marks the <i>thesis</i>. The children, for instance, must make
four movements for a 4/4 time: movements in the air
for the secondary beats, and a more energetic movement
for the <i>thesis</i>. The result is that interest in the succession
of movements replace attention to the fact of most
importance, which is <i>to feel</i> the value of the first beat.
Children who feel the first note because it is played
"strong" and who proceed from one strong beat to the
following strong beat guided by a succession of movements,
are not, it is obvious, following the tune. One
little girl who had been prepared by this method found
herself, on having mistaken the beat, constantly persisting
in her mistake under the guidance of her four movements.
It is like presenting a cube or a triangle to children
of three years with the teacher enumerating the sides,
the angles, the apexes, etc. In reality the children do
not get any notion of the triangle or the cube.</p>

<p>Our children come ultimately to represent the secondary
beats with the slight movements, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_354.jpg" width="417" height="44" alt="drawing" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and then they count them. When we have, gone thus far
we reach the point which is exactly the <i>point of departure</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
for ordinary methods, namely, counting <i>one! two! three!
four!</i> to keep step in time.</div>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>As a practical application of the information already
acquired in the division of time into measures, we next
pass to the exercise of playing the scales in 2/4, 3/4 and
4/4 time and with the triplets. The scale, the classic
type of the melody, lends itself beautifully to these interpretations
of various measures. Every one must have
passed hours at the piano playing simple scales and finding
a delicious variety in the exercise. The <i>do</i> scale itself
may be played, for instance, thus:</p>
<div class='tnote'><small><i>For the remaining musical pieces, click on the
image to hear a midi of the notes played.</i></small></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<a href="music/405_scale_1.mid"><img src="images/i_355a.jpg" width="355" height="70" alt="music" /></a>

<div class='unindent'>or thus:</div>

<a href="music/405_scale_3.mid"><img src="images/i_355c.jpg" width="492" height="68" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<p>Our little piano may be of use in this exercise; but it
is better first to use an exercise more easy for finger movement
and for the position of the hand:</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>Children who have succeeded in identifying and dividing
the melody into measures and the measure itself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
2, 3, 4, understand very easily the time values of the
notes. It is sufficient to let the child <i>hear</i> each exercise
<i>first</i> and he will repeat it with precision. Thus all kinds
of dry explanation of musical <i>values</i> disappear.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>presents no special difficulty if the child has once heard it.</p>

<p>Our next step is to use some exercises for the analysis
of the measure, for instance:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<a href="music/407_scale_1.mid"><img src="images/i_357a.jpg" width="488" height="181" alt="music" /></a>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<a href="music/407_scale_2.mid"><img src="images/i_357b.jpg" width="496" height="394" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<p>The children follow these exercises, marching so as to
put one step on every note. Even children of four years
when prepared with the preceding exercises succeed in
following these with the very greatest interest. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
especially delighted with the long note which keeps them
hanging in position with one foot in front of them on the
line and the other one behind them also on the line. The
position is that of a person who stops before bringing up
the foot which is still behind him.</p>

<p>Since the children already know how to <i>read</i> music,
there is hung up before them a green chart (similar in dimensions
to the musical staffs already familiar to them)
on which is written the exercise which is being played at
the piano by the teacher and which they execute on the
floor-line.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<a href="music/408_scale_1.mid"><img src="images/i_358a.jpg" width="487" height="57" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<a href="music/408_scale_2.mid"><img src="images/i_358b.jpg" width="495" height="62" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<p>Here is another:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<a href="music/408_scale_3.mid"><img src="images/i_358c.jpg" width="490" height="221" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<p>We even give a simple time like this one (composed by
Professor Jean Gibert of the Montessori Primary School
of Barcelona):</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<a href="music/409_tune.mid"><img src="images/i_359a.jpg" width="486" height="64" alt="music" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of course, sooner or later children fix their attention
on the varying form of the notes and discover that this
difference in form bears a relation to differences in time-value
of the notes:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 213px;">
<img src="images/i_359b.jpg" width="213" height="48" alt="notes" />
</div>

<p>This is the time to give in very brief explanation the
lesson on the value of the notes. Thereafter the child may
write from memory a simple melody which the teacher
has first played on the piano. Almost always the child
writes this down with accuracy, showing that he has control
over the musical values appearing in the melody in
question. The child uses for this purpose a large green
chart containing various musical staffs on which movable
notes may be fixed at pleasure. These notes are equipped
with a pin which may be pushed into the wood. The
simple exercises given for the analysis of the measures,
transferred into various keys, can after some practise
in playing them on the system of plates be put into their
copy books by the children. These exercises for measure-analysis
are so simple that the children themselves have
sometimes learned to play them on the piano. It then
has happened that the class went of its own accord into
the piano room; one child began to play and the others
followed the music on the floor-line. The children as they
walk ultimately come to sing the scales and the easy tunes
(of which they have recognized the notes) pronouncing
the names of the notes; but in so pronouncing them they
soften, their voices to the point of attaining an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
which may be called even artistic. When the teacher
plays, the music gains the added charm of harmony, since
the teacher can give not only the simple scale, but the relative
chords, and this gives the scale a vigorous and very
sweet fullness.</p>

<p>These exercises in measure analysis have also been particularly
useful in their application to gymnastic exercises.
The children follow them with gymnastic movements,
using especially the movements of Dalcroze, which
are admirably adapted to the measures of 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, etc.,
and which have a real beauty. We discovered that these
exercises proved to be complexly difficult for the children
who had not practised sufficiently in the interpretation
of the different note values. On the other hand, they were
very easy for those who had come to have a clear feeling
for these different values. This was proof to us that sensorial
preparation must precede these exercises, and furthermore,
that the only difficulty Dalcroze movements encounter
in children arises from insufficient sensory preparation
in the children themselves.</p>

<p>In the same way we illustrate the different details of
of musical writing: the dotted note,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/i_360a.jpg" width="36" height="42" alt="dotted note" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>the triplet:</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 109px;">
<img src="images/i_360b.jpg" width="109" height="73" alt="triplet" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>the <i>legato</i>, the <i>staccato</i>, etc.</div>

<p>Here is an example of a <i>legato</i> effect:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<a href="music/411_quintet.mid"><img src="images/i_361a.jpg" width="471" height="323" alt="music" /></a>
<span class="caption">(Sonnambula. Quintet)</span>
</div>

<p>This example which derives all its expressive value
from the ties, also brings out the value of the note:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/i_361b.jpg" width="116" height="43" alt="notes" />
</div>

<p>We need, accordingly, a collection of musical selections
in which the value of the notes is obvious and clear to such
an extent that the children come to recognize the different
values. This recognition must be obtained by ear through
listening to the music, not by eye looking at the symbols
while the teacher explains.</p>

<p>The 1/4 note always has a different musical content
from the 1/16 note. A musical piece made up of the 16th
or 32d notes has a character of its own (joy or agitation);
and a piece made up of half or whole notes has likewise
its peculiar character (religious, sad, impressive).</p>

<p>The same may be said of every musical symbol, the
value of which is brought out by the note being played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
with that value and in reference to that symbol. It has
been held that in playing for children and in copying
music for the use of children the expression-symbols
should be suppressed. We should observe that these signs
of expression bear to the music the relation that punctuation
bears to the written sentence; their suppression takes away
all value from the notes. For example, the <i>legato</i> and
symbols which indicate that difference (<img src="images/i_362a.jpg" width="53" height="13" alt="symbol" /> and
<img src="images/i_362b.jpg" width="11" height="11" alt="dot" />)
have therefore the greatest value.</p>

<p>The children succeed quite easily in using and reading
the accessory symbols of music. They already know
their meaning through having heard them. We have not
found it necessary to use such signs as <i>sense objects</i>, such
as bars (to be placed on the wooden staff to divide measure
from measure), time fractions, parentheses and so
on. Although we had these manufactured, we ultimately
abandoned them because we found that they were simply
in the way.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we found considerable utility in
our large colored cards with a single staff already described.
On these are written various measures which the
children read with a special pleasure and execute on their
bells.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>With all this a way has been opened to a really musical
education. Once Miss Maccheroni, while executing her
customary rhythmic tunes, reproduced a melodious religious
movement, "<i>O Sanctissima</i>," which the children
heard for the first time. The children all left the line
and gathered around the piano to listen. Two or three
little girls kneeled on the floor and others remained motionless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
executing plastic poses with their arms. This
revealed to us their sensitiveness to melody; they felt
moved not to march but to pray and assume various poses.</p>

<p>We have not yet been able to push our experiments far
enough precisely to define the musical material adapted
to children of various ages. We have, however, made a
very great number of successful attempts to bring children
to enjoy melody and sentimental expression in music.
The practicableness and utility of musical auditions,
or, if you wish, of concerts for children, graduated
in difficulty, executed on various instruments, but on one
instrument at a time, are beyond all question; this applies
above all to songs reproduced by the human voice, when
a well-trained voice is available.</p>

<p>If a real artist should take up the task of analyzing
for children the language of music, bringing them to enjoy
it phrase by phrase and under different <i>timbres</i> (voice,
strings, etc.), his new and scientific application of the art
would be produced in the future from these groups of little
ones, so intelligent in music, who follow the most expressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
tunes with so much passion and in a silence more
absolute than any celebrated artist can dream of attaining
in a meeting of adults! No one among these little
hearers is cold, far away in thought. But on the faces of
the children appears the interior working of a spirit, tasting
a nectar essential to its very live.</p>

<p>How many times a plastic pose, a kneeling posture, an
ecstatic face, will move the heart of the artist to a sense
of joy greater than that which any applause of a throng
of people often indifferent or inattentive, can possibly
give him! Usually only those wounded at heart by the
difficulty of being understood by others, or discouraged
by the coldness or rudeness of other people, or oppressed
by disillusion, or filled with a sense of painful loneliness
or need of expansion in some other way, feel in music
the voice which opens the doors of the heart and causes
a health-giving flood of tears or raises the spirit to a lofty
sense of peace. Only they can understand how necessary
a companion for humanity music is. We know, of course,
to-day that music is an indispensable stimulant for soldiers
rushing forth to die. How much more truly would
it then become a stimulant for all who are to live!</p>

<p>This conviction is already in the hearts of many people.
In fact, attempts have already been made to reach
the populace by concerts in the public squares and by
making concert halls accessible to people of every class;
but after all, do such attempts amount to more than putting
the cheap editions of the classics into circulation
among illiterates? Education is the prime requisite;
without such education we have a people of deaf mutes
forever barred from any music. The ear of the uneducated
man cannot perceive the sublime sounds which
music would bring within his reach. That is why though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the music of Bellini and Wagner is being played in public
squares, the saloons are just as full as before.</p>

<p>If, however, from these pupils of ours a whole people
could grow up, it would be sufficient to go through the
streets with a good piece of music and everybody would
come out to hear. All those places where the rough and
abandoned wrecks of humanity seek enjoyment, like homeless
dogs looking for food in our ash-cans, would be emptied
as if by magic. We would have an actual realization
of the Allegory of Orpheus; for hearts which are to-day of
stone would then be stirred and brought to life by a sublime
melody.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Singing</span></h3>

<p>Singing began with the scale. The singing of a scale,
first in accompaniment with the bells and later with the
piano is a first and great delight to the children. They
sing it in various ways, now in a low voice, now very
loud, now all together in unison, now one by one. They
sing divided into two groups, sharing the notes alternately
between them. Among the songs which we offer to
the children, the greatest favorite proved to be the syllabic
Gregorian Chant. It is something like a very perfect
form of speech. It has a conversational intonation,
the softness of a sentence well pronounced, the full roundness
of the musical phrase. The examples given here
have almost the movement of the scale.</p>

<p>Many other verses of the Gregorian Chant have, like
these, proved to be the delight of the Montessori Elementary
School of Barcelona. There the children are especially
keen about this very simple music which they like to
play on the piano, on their plates (Xylophones) or on
their monochords.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<h2>V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MUSICAL AUDITIONS</div>


<p>The movement entitled "O Sanctissima," played by
Miss Maccheroni one day by chance among the rhythmic
exercises, is regarded by us as an introduction to <i>musical
audition</i>. It will be recalled that the children had been
accustomed to alter their style of marching on the floor-line
according to changes in the music. It had never,
however, occurred to them to leave the line. When this
piece was played they all crowded around the piano, motionless,
thoughtful, absorbed; while two or three little
ones fell to their knees and assumed various poses. This
experience suggested to us the idea of "musical auditions,"
if you wish "concerts for children."</p>

<p>Children, little by little to be sure, but no less admirably,
enter into the spirit of music. After the numerous
rhythmic exercises, as soon, that is, as they have mastered
the problem of measure, almost any <i>sonata</i> is within their
reach. They can handle not isolated movements merely,
but whole pieces of music. The same is true of the auditions.
At first, of course, it is better to select simple
phrases; but gradually the children come to enjoy "the
best music," joyfully recognizing the feeling which it
expresses and which inspired it. Our pupils used to exclaim,
for instance: "This piece is for weeping,"
"This is for prayer," "Now we must laugh," "Now we
must shout," etc.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, insist too strongly on the need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
for the greatest possible care in the execution of the selections
used. A child audience is a very special one. It
demands something more than is expected by the average
"intelligent audience." It is one in which musical
intelligence must be <i>developed</i>. Our object must be the
creation not merely of higher and higher grades of understanding
but also of higher and higher grades of <i>feeling</i>.
In this sense, we can never <i>do too much</i> for the children.
It is a task not beneath the dignity of the greatest composers,
the most accomplished technicians. Indeed, any
one of such might well esteem it a privilege some day to
hear it said of his work that it aroused the first love for
music in the hearts of one of these little ones. For thus
music would have been made a companion, a consoler, a
guardian angel of man! It is of course not the lot of all
of us to attain the exalted position of greatness whether as
artists or technicians. We must content ourselves with
assuming an obligation: with <i>giving</i> all the soul and all
the skill we possess. We must conceive of ourselves as
transmitters of the largess of music to our children. We
must deeply feel our calling as bestowers of a divine gift.</p>

<p>The following titles were all used successfully by us in
our experiments. They are supplements to the "O
Sanctissima" and a "Pater Noster."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STUDY OF METRICS IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLS</div>


<p>One of the novelties included in our experiments was
the teaching of metrics, hitherto reserved for high schools.
The love shown by children for poetry, their exquisite
sensitiveness to rhythm, led me to suspect that the native
roots of poetry might be present in little children. I suggested
to Miss Maria Fancello, a teacher of literature in
the high schools and my colleague, to attempt such an experiment.
She began with children of different ages, and,
together, we succeeded in discovering a highly interesting
department of education, the object of which might be to
give the mass of the people, prepared for life in the primary
schools, the basic elements of literary appreciation,
thus opening a new source of pleasure calculated also to
increase general enlightenment. A populace capable of
enjoying poetry, of judging the beauty of verse, and hence
of coming in contact with the spirits of our greatest poets,
would be something quite different to the masses we new
know. To find the like we have to imagine the people of
ancient story, who talked in poetry and moved their bodies
to the rhythm, thus laying the foundations of refined civilization.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to describe in detail all we did
in these experiments. It will be sufficient to summarize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the results, which may suggest useful material end methods
to others.</p>

<p>As soon as the children are somewhat advanced in
reading, poetry, which they loved so much in "Children's
House," may be included in the materials offered
in partial satisfaction of their insatiable desire to read.
It is best to begin with poems composed of stanzas of different
lengths, the stanzas being printed at easily noticeable
intervals from each other. The lines may be
counted, in teaching the two new words "stanza" and
"line." The process involved is a recognition of "objects,"
suggesting the first exercise in reading, where the
children put <i>names</i> on things; though here the situation
is much simpler. At the same time we have the exercise
of counting the lines. In short, it is a review exercise
of the greatest simplicity.</p>

<p>The counting of the lines leads at once to the identification
of such groups as the couplet, quatrain, octave, etc.
But little time is spent on such a crude detail. The little
ones almost immediately become interested in the rhyme.
The first step is the recognition of rhyming syllables
which are underlined with colored pencils, using a different
color for each rhyme. Seven-year-olders take the
greatest delight in this work, which is too simple to arouse
interest in children of eight or nine. Those of seven do
such work about as quickly as those of ten, the speed of
the younger children being due apparently to their enthusiasm,
the slowness of the older to their lack of interest.
We may note in passing that these exercises furnish
tests of absolute exactness as to rapidity of work.
Children of eight are able to go one step beyond marking
the rhymes with colored pencils. They can use the more
complicated device of marking lines with the letters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
alphabet: aa, bb, cc, etc. Marking with numbers to the
left the lines in their order, and the rhymes with letters
to the right, we get a specimen result as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Markings table">

</table></div>

<p>(Translation: "Wandering swallow, as you sit there
on my balcony each morning, singing to me your tearful
song, what is it you are trying to tell me in your language,
wandering swallow?")</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This brings out the difference between the alternating
rhyme (a, b, a, b) and the couplet (c, c), as well as the
morphology of the stanza.</p>

<div class='thb'>. . . . . . .</div>

<p>In reading the lines over and over again to work out
the rhyme scheme, the children spontaneously begin to
catch the tonic accents. Their readiness in this respect
is a matter of common observation. In fact, in ordinary
schools, the teachers are continually struggling against
the "sing-song" developed by children in reading poetry.
This "sing-song" is nothing more nor less that stress on
the rhythmic movement.</p>

<p>On one occasion, one of our children, a little boy, had
been spending some time over a number of decasyllabic
lines. While waiting in the corridor for the doors to open
at dismissal time, he suddenly began to walk up and down
"right-about-facing" at every three steps and saying
aloud: "tatatá, tatatá, tatatátta," right-about-face, then
"tatatá, tatatá, tatatátta." Each step was accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
by a gesture in the air with his little clenched fist. This
tot was marching to the verse rhythm, just as he would
have marched to music. It was a case of perfectly interpretative
"gymnastic rhythm." His gestures fell on the
three tonic accents of the Italian decasyllable, the right-about
marked the end of the "verse"&mdash;the "turn" in
the line, which he indicated by "turning" himself around
to begin over again.</p>

<p>When the children have reached such a stage of sensory
development, they have no difficulty in recognizing
the tonic accents. For this purpose, we have prepared
sheets with poems written in a clear hand. The children
mark with a neatly drawn accent the letter on which the
rhythmic accent falls. The material should be systematically
presented. We found from experience that the
children first discover the accents in <i>long</i> lines made up
of <i>even-numbered</i> syllables (parisyllabic lines), where
the accents recur at regular intervals and are clearly
called for both by sense, word accent and rhythm. We
were able to establish the following sequence for various
Italian lines, which present a graduated series of difficulties
to the child in recognizing the accents:</p>

<p>1. Decasyllables: example:</p>

<div class='poem'>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Manzoni</span>, <i>La battaglia di Maclodio.</i>)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "A trumpet call sounds to the right;

shakes with the charge of horses and men. Here a standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
is broken out to the breeze; there another advances
waving; here a line of troops appears, there another rushing
against it.")</p>

<p>2. Dodecasyllables: example:</p>

<div class='poem'>

</div>

<p>(Translation: "Ruello, Ruello, as fast as you can!
O storm-winds of heaven, lend us your wings; my loved
one is lying near death; onward, onward, onward,
Ruello!")</p>

<p>3. Eight syllable lines (<i>ottonario</i>): example:</p>

<div class='poem'>

A te vi<b>é</b>ne afflitto c<b>ó</b>r,<br />

</div>

<p>(Translation: "O deserted wood! To your shade
the sorrowing heart comes to find some rest in your cool
silence.")</p>

<p>4. Six syllable lines (<i>senario</i>): example:</p>

<div class='poem'>

L'uom <b>ú</b>ltimo gi<b>ú</b>nto<br />
Le c<b>é</b>neri pr<b>é</b>me<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<span class="smcap">Zanella</span>, <i>La conchiglia fossile</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "Radiant with hope, the latest comer
treads on the ashes of a dead world, pursuing the glowing
aspirations of ages not yet ripe.")</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note:</span> In the above selections the vowels in broad-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
type have been marked with an accent by the child, to indicate
the rhythmic beat.</p>

<p>We found, on the other hand, that greater difficulty is
experienced by the children in lines where the syllables
are in odd-numbers (imparisyllabics), the hardest of the
Italian lines being the hendecasyllable, which is a combination
of the seven syllable and the five syllable line,
fused together with all their great varieties of movement.</p>

<p>We established the following gradation of difficulties:</p>

<p>1. Seven syllable line (<i>settenario</i>): example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Gi<b>à</b> ri<b>é</b>de Pr<b>í</b>mav<b>é</b>ra<br />
Col s<b>ú</b>o flor<b>í</b>to asp<b>é</b>tto,<br />
Gi<b>à</b> il gr<b>á</b>to z<b>é</b>ffir<b>é</b>tto<br />
Sch<b>é</b>rza fra l'<b>é</b>rbe e i fi<b>ó</b>r.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Metastasio</span>, <i>Primavera</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "Now already flowery Spring returns;
again the lovely zephyrs dance amidst the grass and blossoms.")</p>

<p>2. Five syllable line (<i>quinario</i>): example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Viv<b>á</b>ce s<b>í</b>mbolo<br />
D<b>é</b> la fam<b>í</b>glia,<br />
Le di<b>è</b> la tr<b>é</b>mula<br />
M<b>á</b>dre a la f<b>í</b>glia,<br />
Le di<b>è</b> la su<b>ó</b>cera<br />
Bu<b>ó</b>na a la nu<b>ó</b>ra<br />
Ne l'<b>ú</b>ltim' <b>ó</b>ra.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Mazzoni</span>, <i>Per un mazzo di chiavi</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "As a vivid symbol of the home, they
were passed on by the dying mother to her daughter or to
her son's wife.")</p>

<p>3. Nine syllable line (<i>novenario</i>): example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Te tr<b>í</b>ste! Che a v<b>á</b>lle t'asp<b>é</b>ttano<br />
I gi<b>ó</b>rni di c<b>á</b>ntici pr<b>í</b>vi;<br />
Ah n<b>ó</b>, non dai m<b>ó</b>rti che t'<b>á</b>mano,<br />
Ti gu<b>á</b>rda, frat<b>é</b>llo, dai v<b>í</b>vi.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Cavallotti</span>, <i>Su in alto</i>.)</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>(Translation: "Alas, for thee, O brother! Yonder,
songless days await thee. Ah no, have no fear of the
dead: they love thee! The living only shouldst thou
fear!")</p>

<p>4. Hendecasyllable: example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Per me si v<b>á</b> nella citt<b>á</b> dol<b>é</b>nte,<br />
Per me si v<b>á</b> nell'et<b>é</b>rno dol<b>ó</b>re,<br />
Per me si v<b>á</b> tra la perd<b>ú</b>ta g<b>é</b>nte.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Dante</span>, <i>Divina Commedia, Inferno</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "Through me ye enter the city of sorrow;
through me ye enter the realm of eternal grief;
through me ye enter the regions of the damned").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typical ending of these various lines is the trochee
(<img src="images/i_389a.jpg" width="42" height="13" alt="symbols long dash U" />, <i>verso piano</i>). The iambic (<img src="images/i_389b.jpg" width="43" height="15" alt="symbols U long dash" />, <i>verso tronco</i>)
and the dactyllic (<img src="images/i_389c.jpg" width="66" height="15" alt="symbols long dash UU" />, <i>verso sdrucciolo</i>) endings (requiring
respectively one syllable less and one syllable more
than the <i>verso piano</i>) constitute occasional variations. We
have found that these rarer lines are recognized rather as
curiosities than as difficulties by the children who easily
refer them to their respective normal types. They are accordingly
presented in our material along with the common
verses of trochaic endings. Our illustration of the
five syllable line given above showed specimens of the dactyllic
ending (<i>sdrucciolo</i>, <img src="images/i_389c.jpg" width="66" height="15" alt="symbols long dash UU" />). Here is another example
of alternating trochaic (<i>piano</i>) and dactyllic endings:</p>

<div class='poem'>
In c<b>í</b>ma a un <b>á</b>lbero<br />
C'<b>é</b> un uccell<b>í</b>no<br />
Di nu<b>ó</b>vo g<b>é</b>nere....<br />
Che s<b>í</b>a un bamb<b>í</b>no?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">L. Schwarz</span>, <i>Uccellino</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "There's a very strange little bird up
in that tree! Why, it's a little child!")</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the following decasyllables, the trochaic ending alternates
with the iambic (<i>tronco</i>):</p>

<div class='poem'>
Lungi, l<b>ú</b>ngi, su l'<b>á</b>li del c<b>á</b>nto<br />
Di qui l<b>ú</b>ngi rec<b>á</b>re io ti v<b>ó</b>'<br />
Là, ne i c<b>á</b>mpi fior<b>í</b>ti del s<b>á</b>nto<br />
Gange, un lu<b>ó</b>go bell<b>í</b>ssimo, io s<b>ó</b>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Carducci</span>, <i>Lungi, lungi</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "I will take thee far, far away on the
wings of my song: there, among the flowery fields of the
sacred Ganges, I know of a beautiful spot").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some difficulty arose, however, when we came to lines
with alternations of parisyllables and imparisyllables;
though this new movement aroused real enthusiasm among
the children, who greeted it as a new and strange music.
It often happened that after the pleasurable effort of analyzing
a poem with lines alternating in this way, the
pupils would choose as "recreation" the study of lines
of even-numbered syllables. Here is an example of the
new type:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Eran trec<b>é</b>nto, eran gi<b>ó</b>vani e f<b>ó</b>rti,<br />
E s<b>ó</b>no m<b>ó</b>rti!<br />
Me ne and<b>á</b>vo al matt<b>í</b>no a spigol<b>á</b>re<br />

S'è ritorn<b>á</b>ta ed è ven<b>ú</b>ta a t<b>é</b>rra:<br />
Sceser con l'<b>á</b>rmi, e a noi non f<b>é</b>cer gu<b>é</b>rra.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Prati</span>, <i>La spigolatrice di Sapri</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "There were three hundred, young
and strong! And now they are dead! That morning
I was gleaning in the fields; I saw a boat at sea,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
steamer flying the white, red and green. It stopped at
Ponza, remained a while and then came back&mdash;came back
and approached the shore. They came ashore in arms,
but to us they did no harm").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the rhythmic accents were being studied, we
found that the discovery of the cæsura (interior pause)
formed an interesting recreative diversion. In fact this
work aroused so much enthusiasm that the children went
from exercise to exercise, continuing at study for extended
periods, and far from showing signs of weariness,
actually increased their joyous application. One little
girl, in the first six minutes of her work, marked the
cæsura of seventy-six ten-syllable lines without making a
mistake. An abundant material is necessary for this exercise.
Example:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Dagli atri muscosi,  dai fori cadenti,<br />
Dai boschi, dall'arse  fucine stridenti,<br />
Dai solchi bagnati  di servo sudor,<br />
Un volgo disperso  repente si desta,<br />
Intende l'orecchio,  solleva la testa,<br />
Percosso da novo  crescente rumor.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<span class="smcap">Manzoni</span>, <i>Italiani e Longobardi</i>.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>(Translation: "From the damp atria, from the ruined
squares, from the forests, from the hissing forges, from
the fields bathed with the sweat of slaves, a scattered
horde of men suddenly is roused. They listen, lift their
heads, startled at this strange increasing roar").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The step forward to the perception of the syllabic units
of the line is a purely sensory phenomenon: it is analogous
to marking the time of music without taking account
of the measure divisions. Syllabiating according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
rhythm and beating on the table with the fingers solve even
the subtler difficulties such as dieresis and synalepha, in
recognizing the rhythmic syllables. Examples:</p>

<div class='center'>
La | so | mma | sa | pi | en | za e'l | pri | mo A | mo | re<br />
</div>

<p>We print this verse in the above form, because it was thus
divided by a child in his very first spontaneous effort at
syllabiation. As a matter of fact, we present the material
normally according to graded difficulties, using over again
for this purpose the materials used in the study of accents.
At this point also the accents themselves suddenly
acquire a new interest, for the child is able to observe
on "what syllable they fall." Thus his metrical
study approaches completion, for now he can readily acquire
the nomenclature of metrics and versification: <i>dodecasyllable</i>,
<i>hendecasyllable</i>, etc. Then, combining his
knowledge of the numbers of syllables and the location
of the rhythmic accents, the child is at the point of discovering
the rhythmic laws of verse construction. We
were expecting the children to begin producing definitions
like the following: "The dodecasyllable line has twelve
syllables and four accents which fall on the second, fifth,
eighth and eleventh syllables," etc. The spontaneous impulse
of the pupils led instead to the construction of "mirrors"
or "checkerboards" like the following:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>The additional step to using the symbols of metrics was
an easy one, and a graphic diagram resulted much as follows:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>The next development is a complete study of the stanza
or strophe in the form of a summary; the number of
lines, the rhymes, the accents, number and location of the
syllables. To <i>distinguish</i> between the stanzas is also to
classify them, which becomes a pleasing task for the children.</p>

<p>One little girl, who was making a summary study of
four terzets of Dante, suddenly called the teacher to inform
her with an expression of complete surprise: "See,
the rhyme always begins at the last accent!" She had
before her:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Per me si va nella città dol<i>ente;</i><br />
Per me si va nell'eterno dol<i>ore;</i><br />
Per me si va tra la perduta g<i>ente</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Giustizia mosse il mio alto fatt<i>ore;</i></span><br />
Fecemi la divina potest<i>ate</i>,<br />
La somma sapienza e il primo am<i>ore</i>.<br />
Dinanzi a me non fur cose cre<i>ate</i>....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(Dante: Inscription over Gate of Hell.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>So in metrics also the children, following the natural
inclinations of their growth, pass from sensory discipline,
to intelligent cognition, and graphic representation.
Then they become the "explorers of their environment,"
the "discoverers" of general laws.</p>

<div class='thb'>* * *</div>



<p>Translator's Note: The basis of Italian verse is in the
syllable count, and the rhythmic accent. In English
verse, however, the question of the syllable count is dependent
on a much more complex consideration: syllable
length; and syllable length, in its turn, is conditioned not
only by the phonetic situation in and around the syllable,
but by rhetorical stress as well. It is clear that Signora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Montessori's experiments on the simpler Italian line have
little direct bearing, save as an illustration of method, on
the pedagogy of English Metrics. For whereas, the principal
classifications of Italian lines involve merely the
problem of syllabiation (complicated by dieresis and synalepha),
with a numerical terminology (<i>quinario</i>, <i>ottonario</i>,
<i>decasillabo</i>, etc.), the study of English versification
demands an analysis of measure (feet) and of number of
feet, with a terminology relative to each: trochee, iambus,
dactyl, spondee, anapest, etc., hexameter, pentameter, etc.,
to mention only the most obvious elements of a science
which, applied even to simple English verse, soon becomes
extremely complicated. How much, then, of the study of
English metrics, beyond the elementary concepts of stanza
and rhyme, should be included in the Montessori Advanced
Method, and what order of presentation of facts
should be followed, still remains to be experimentally
determined.</p>

<p>However, the most illuminating fact, as regards method,
which detaches from Signora Montessori's experiments
with metrical forms, is that <i>long parisyllables</i> are more
readily analyzed by children than imparisyllables; and
secondly that <i>short</i> imparisyllables prove easier than long
imparisyllables. We might wish more explicit evidence
that the hardest parisyllable is easier, therefore more <i>natural</i>,
than the easiest imparisyllable&mdash;implied in Signora
Montessori's presentation of this subject. Even so,
her conclusions are interesting, and from more than one
point of view. It will be recalled that the most ancient
and the most fortunate of the meters used in French, Spanish,
and Provençal poetry is precisely the decasyllable
(<i>Song of Roland</i>, the Provençal <i>Boecis</i>, etc.), whereas the
favorite line of old Italian popular poetry was the octo-syllabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
verse. These are both parisyllables, though the
succession of <i>theses</i>, or rhythmic beats, is not quite analogous
to that of the modern Italian verses used in this
experiment. It would seem, in fact, as though the children
initiated by Signora Montessori into metrical studies,
were actually traversing the earlier experiences of their
Latin race.</p>

<p>Doubtless the reason why the parisyllable submits
more readily to rhythmic analysis than imparisyllables, is
that when the syllables are in even numbers, the line tends
to reduce to two simple rhythmic groups&mdash;the decasyllable
to groups of 4 and 6, with two rhythmic beats in
each group; the dodecasyllable to groups of 6 and 6 (therefore
of 3 and 3 and 3 and 3); the octosyllables to groups
of 4 and 4; the six syllable to groups of 3 and 3. The
imparisyllables on the contrary are rarely capable of such
division&mdash;of such <i>monotony</i>, if you wish. They lend
themselves to more complex rhythm, especially to "paragraphic"
treatment. They are distinctly the rhythms
of erudite, "cultivated," "literary" poetry.</p>

<p>We should suspect, accordingly, that what appears in
the above experiments as <i>length</i> is in reality <i>reducibility</i>
to simpler forms; and that lines capable of such reduction
should be given first in an adaptation of Signora Montessori's
method. It is, however, highly improbable
that in English, where the only constant element in
rhythm is the stress and not the syllable count, the line
compounded of two simpler rhythmic groups should prove
easier for the child than either of those simpler groups
themselves. We see no reason to assume, for instance,
than an eight-stress line, reducible to two four-stress lines,
should be more readily analyzed than a four-stress line;
or that a seven-stress line, reducible to a four-stress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
a three-stress line, should be easier than either one of
these. In fact, the predominance of these simpler elements
in the English feeling for these longer groups is
indicated by the fact that such compound lines are commonly
broken into their constituent parts when printed
(cf. <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>), even in cases where the isolation
of these parts is not emphasized and rendered natural
by rhyme. It will be observed that in the Montessori
experiment the order of presentation was first, three-stress
(anapestic), then four-stress (iambic), then two-stress
(iambic) lines. This situation happens to correspond
to that found in the commonest popular English
verse, which gives undoubted preference, as witness our
nursery rimes, to three-stress and four-stress iambics.
Two-stress lines constitute in reality four-stress lines divided
by rhyme; just as, in poems of distinctly literary
savor, the two-stress line is further reducible by interior
rhyme to two one-stress lines.</p>

<p>While the remainder of the exercises in syllabication
and graphic transcription, as described by Dr. Montessori,
would seem to follow naturally on the above exercises
in the analysis of line stress, it is clear that additional
attention must be given to questions of terminology.
For the metrical syntheses performed in the tables
at the end of the preceding section will not be possible
for English poetry unless the child is able to identify
the kinds of feet and the kinds of lines. We suggest accordingly
two supplementary drills with the card system
familiar to the child from his exercises in grammar. The
first consists of a list of words, each on a separate card,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
with the tonic accent marked. Each word with its accent
represents a foot (iambus, trochee, anapest, dactyl),
indicated on the card in graphic transcription beneath
the word:</p>

<div class='center'>
wóndering<br /></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/i_405a.jpg" width="70" height="16" alt="symbols" />
</div>

<p>Corresponding to each word is another card bearing
simply the graphic transcription and the name of the
foot. The exercise, of the greatest simplicity, is to pair
off the cards, arranging the words in a column on the
table, putting after each the card that describes it. The
cards, when properly arranged, read as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="words and accents">
<tr>
<td align="left">betweén</td>
<td align="left"><img src="images/i_405a--iambus.jpg" width="38" height="17" alt="symbols" /> iambus</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><img src="images/i_405a.jpg" width="70" height="16" alt="symbols" /></td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>A second stage of this exercise consists in offering a
similar series of cards where, however, the word-cards are
without the indication of the tonic accent and without
the graphic transcription of the measure:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="words and accents">
<tr>
<td align="left">suggest</td>
<td align="left"><img src="images/i_405a--iambus.jpg" width="38" height="17" alt="symbols" /> iambus</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">accent</td>
<td align="left"><img src="images/i_405b-trochee.jpg" width="38" height="16" alt="symbols" /> trochee</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">metrical</td>
<td align="left"><img src="images/i_405a.jpg" width="70" height="16" alt="symbols" />dactyl</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>An identical exercise is possible for whole lines. The
first stage consists of naming the lines accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the metrical transcription with cards containing simply
the transcription and the name of the meter; in the second
stage, the same lines are given but on cards without
the graphic transcription: for example:</p>

<p>When these fundamental notions have been acquired the
child is ready for the more difficult problems of anacrusis,
catalexis, irregular feet and irregular pauses, which he can
recognize in almost any poem of considerable length by
comparing the transcription of a given foot with specimen
transcriptions of regular lines, which are always accessible

<h2>APPENDIX II</h2>

<h3>SUMMARY OF THE LECTURES ON PEDAGOGY DELIVERED
IN HOME AT THE <i>SCUOLA MAGISTRALE
ORTOFRENICA</i> IN 1900</h3>

<p>This appendix contains a summary of a few of my
lectures delivered in 1900 in the Scuola Magistrate Ortofrenica
in Rome and published in pamphlet form for the
benefit of the teacher-students who were attending that
course. A number of distinguished physicians were at
the same time lecturing in the school on various subjects&mdash;such
as Psychology, Esthesiology, Anatomy of the
Nerve Centres, etc. I had reserved for myself the teaching,
or rather the development, of a special pedagogy for
defective children, along the lines previously laid down by
Itard and Séguin.</p>

<p>In the summary of these old lectures of mine are included
some of my experiments with certain subjects
taught in the elementary grades. They show that the
origin of my present work with older children
is to be sought in my teaching of defectives.</p>

<p>I still possess, as documentary relics of this course, a
hundred copies of a pamphlet entitled: <i>Riassunte delle
lezioni di didattica della Prof<sup>ssa</sup> Montessori, anno 1900,
Stab. Lit. Romano, via Frattina 62, Roma.</i> More than
three hundred teachers followed my course, and are able
to bear witness to the work done there.</p>

<p>I republish the following excerpts not because I consider
my work so important as to merit the preservation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
all the documents touching on its origin, but to prevent the
giving of undue prominence to those remnants of my
earlier attempts and studies which are still to be found in
the Scuola Magistrale Ortofrenica in Rome.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The child should be led from the education of the muscular
system to that of the nervous end sensory systems; from the
education of the senses to concepts; from concepts to general
ideas; from general ideas to morality. This is the educational
method of Séguin."</p>

<p>However, before we begin education, we must prepare the
child to receive it by another education which is to-day regarded
as of the very first importance. This preparatory education
is the foundation on which all subsequent education must
be based, and the success we obtain in it will determine the success
of our subsequent efforts. by preparatory education I here
mean <i>hygienic education</i>, which in defective children sometimes
includes medical treatment. That is why the educational
method for defectives is sometimes described as <i>medico-pedagogical</i>.</p>

<p>Those who realize that importance of feeling and internal sensation
in education will understand that the bodily organism
must function properly in order to respond to our educational
efforts. We must preserve good health where good health exists:
we must restore it where it is lacking.</p>

<p>We are therefore under strict obligation to pay close attention
to nutrition and to the condition of the vital organs.
Every one is aware of the close relation existing between general
sensibility and morality. Criminals and prostitutes show
very scant sensitiveness to pain and to tactile stimuli. The
same situation is frequently apparent in defectives; hence the
necessity of restoring the tactile sense with adequate attention
to hygiene.</p>

<p>We cannot educate the muscles to perform a given coordinate
movement if they have lost their power of functioning (as in paresis, etc.).
Education, properly so-called, must be preceded
by a medical treatment to restore the muscles, if possible, to
good health.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be impossible to educate, for example, the sense of
hearing, if some pathological situation has produced partial
deafness. We cannot educate the sense of smell if the excessive
excretion of mucus prevents external stimuli from acting
on the ends of the sensory nerves. Obviously, we need a
medical treatment to remove these diseased conditions.</p>


<h3>MEDICAL EDUCATION</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>General baths:</i> When not too prolonged they develop the sensibility
of the nervous papillæ. They give tone to the cellular and
muscular tissues, especially to the skin.</p>

<p><i>Hot and cold baths</i> given alternately are a powerful educational
instrument in attracting the attention of a child to his external
environment.</p>

<p><i>Local hot baths</i> may be given to areas deficient in sensibility. For
instance, try bathing the hands if tactile education proves impossible,
or bathe the feet if the defect in standing upright or in walking
comes from the insensitiveness of the soles.</p>

<p><i>Local cold baths:</i> Given to the head while the patient is entirely
covered in warm water are a tonic to the scalp; they facilitate the
knitting of the bones of the skull and the formation of wormian
bones, preventing also cerebral congestion. They stimulate and regularize
the cerebral circulation. Such baths are particularly useful
for hydro-cephalics and micro-cephalics, but all patients are benefited
by such baths, which are the most generally useful of all.</p>

<p><i>Steam baths</i> develop perspiration which at times is completely
absent or partial in defectives, causing serious physical disturbances.
These baths, furthermore, predispose the nerve ends to the
most intense sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Such baths are, however, not to be used on epileptics or on children
suffering from rickets, weak circulation or general debility.</p>

<p>In general, <i>local steam baths</i> are used especially for hands and
feet, and also for the tongue.</p>

<p><i>General cold baths</i> are used in cases of super-excitation, motor-hyperactivity,
excessive sensitiveness to pain and touch. These baths
must be accompanied by constant cold lotions on the head.</p>

<p>Baths may be accompanied, with good results, by <i>massage</i> and
<i>rubbing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rubbings</i> may be given dry or with water, alcohol, aromatic
creams or ointments.</p>

<p>Local rubbings may be applied: (a) <i>To the spine</i>, carefully avoiding
the lumbar region so as not to excite the sexual sensibilities. Dry
rubbings should be made with a piece of flannel and continued until
the skin reddens. They are especially useful after hot baths followed
by cold douches. (b) <i>To the chest</i> to stimulate respiration. (c)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
<i>To the abdomen</i> to correct various internal disorders (here, however,
massage is more efficacious). (d) <i>To the joints</i> (rubbings with
aromatic creams and with alcohol are very effective).</p>

<p>A brief rubbing with alcohol or creams can be followed with good
effect by massage in the case of abdomen and joints. Massage
on the abdomen stimulates circulation in the intestines and intensifies
and regularizes the movements of the muscular walls.</p>

<p>Massage has a surprising effect on the muscles of the joints; it
shocks the muscular fibers in their innermost parts and sets them in
motion; it regularizes the functioning of the muscles by reducing
excessive contraction and restoring deficient contractibility. Emaciated
muscles are regenerated, the muscular bulk is vigorously augmented,
while the fat tissues are absorbed.</p>

<p>The repetition several times a day of bathing, rubbing and massage
has produced real miracles of physical regeneration.</p></blockquote>


<h3>FEEDING</h3>

<blockquote><p>Intestinal disturbances have a direct influence on the functional
power of the central nervous system. They merit, therefore,
special consideration. For in defectives an intestinal inflammation
may produce symptoms of meningitis, and a
disorder in digestion even unattended by fever may occasionally
give rise to convulsions.</p>

<p>The hygiene of feeding which is almost the same as that for
normal children must therefore be rigorously observed.</p>

<p>The general rule is list the children should have regular
meals and be allowed nothing whatever to eat between meals.
It is commonly believed that a piece of candy or a bit of fruit
given between meals has no bad effect. This is a common error
of many mothers, who by allowing such slight irregularities
in diet, become the unwitting cause of serious illnesses in their
children. When we say that children should be fed at mealtimes,
we mean that <i>nothing</i> should be given them <i>except</i> at
meal times; nothing, not even the most innocent confection; not
a crumb of bread, not a drop of milk. This severity has the
quantity and quality of food allowed in each.</p>

<p><i>Number:</i> For children between 2 and 7 years: 4 meals a
day; for children between 8 and 14 years: 3 meals a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
These meals should be at regular hours, and followed without
exception by a period of mental rest, which must be provided
for in making up the daily program of lessons.</p>

<p>We need special researches as to what type of activity may
be allowed children during digestion and what organs may be
active without damage to the child while the stomach is taxed
with the labor of digestion. A few things are clear. The children
should be sent out of closed rooms where their play raises
more or less dust, and kept in well-ventilated places, if possible,
in a garden or in a woods well supplied with aromatic trees.
The best thing a child can do immediately after a meal is to
take a short walk in the open air without much exertion.</p>

<p><i>Quantity:</i> In the case of children between 2 and 7 years
of age, there should be two full meals and two luncheons.
After the age of 7 there should be one lunch and two full meals.
We cannot be more specific.</p>

<p><i>Quality:</i> In the case of defectives it would be useful for
the doctor to order a diet day by day after having examined
the diaries of the nurses as is done in hospitals. For it may
be possible to introduce into the food elements which constitute
an actual cure for certain diseased conditions and preventives
of certain kinds of attacks. In food we should realize
the distinctions between the elements which build tissues&mdash;true
food substances, and others whose function is purely stimulatory&mdash;alcohol,
coffee, tea, etc., which should be used only
occasionally.</p>

<p>Among the food substances properly so-called are the albuminoids
(proteins), fats, and carbo-hydrates (sugars, starches,
wheat and potato flours, etc.). The fats are the least digestible
foods, but they produce the greatest number of calories.</p>

<p>The proportion of the different elements in the food should
be determined by the amount of albumin, which constitutes the
real food element. Albumin is of both vegetable and animal
origin. Its animal forms are more nutritious, more easily digestible,
and products more calories than the vegetable forms.
The foods which produce animal-albumin are milk, eggs, and
meats. Vegetables themselves furnish what is known as vegetable-albumin.
Children up to 8 years of age are supplied
usually with the following albuminous foods: eggs, milk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
vegetables. For children between 6 and 8: eggs, milk, fish and
vegetables may be provided. Older children may be given
chicken, veal, and finally beef.</p>

<p>Though for normal children a restricted meat diet is desirable,
in the case of defectives a rich supply of meat as well
as of albuminoids in general is to be sought. Their treatment
resembles that of weak convalescent patients whose strength is
to be restored. The meats best adapted to such children are
those containing large amounts of mucilaginous substances and
sugar (veal, lamb and young animals in general). Vegetable
<i>purées</i>, fat gravies, butter, etc., are to be recommended in these
cases.</p>

<p>For <i>nervous children</i>, fats, oils, acids, and flours should be
avoided.</p>

<p>For <i>apathetic children</i>, who experience difficulty in digestion,
tonics and rich seasonings should be used, such as spices, which
have come to be almost excluded from ordinary cooking, especially
for children. Spices may well be restored to the diet
of institutions for defectives, since they have the additional
advantage of permitting mixture with irons, of which they
neutralize the taste.</p>

<p>Questions of food depend largely upon the individual condition
of the children. The important thing is to avoid "the
school ration." This is all the more true of beverages.</p>

<p><i>Beverages:</i> While stimulants are usually to be excluded from
the diet of normal children of 7 or under, it is often desirable
to introduce tea, coffee, etc., into the meals of defectives. This
should be done, however, only in the daily diets ordered by the
physician for individuals.</p>

<p><i>Nervous children</i> should be restricted to milk and water for
their meals with some moderately sweet drink (orange juice,
weak lemonade, etc.) after eating.</p>

<p><i>Apathetics</i>, showing atonic digestion, may have coffee either
before eating or during their meals.</p>

<p>Special education is necessary to accustom the children to
complete mastication. Such practice in the use of the organs
of mastication assists also in the later development of speech.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p></blockquote>


<h3>EXCRETION</h3>

<blockquote><p>Among the physiological irregularities that appear among
children special importance attaches to excretions.</p>

<p><i>Defecation:</i> Among defectives especially, so-called "dirty
children" are often so numerous that special sections have to
be made for them in institutions. Such children show involuntary
losses of fæces and urine, as in the case of infants.
Most frequently the defecations are of liquid consistency though
sometimes the reverse is true. Our remedial effort should be in
two directions: we should try to regularize the operation of the
intestines by giving solidity to the excretions; secondly, we
should endeavor to strengthen the sphincter muscles.</p>

<p>A strict observance of the diet hygiene outlined above, especially
as concerns regularity of meals and mastication of food,
will assist in the attainment of the first object. We should try
in addition to regularize defecation by stimulating it at regular
intervals (to be gradually increased in length) through light
massages and hot rubbings on the abdomen.</p>

<p>To strengthen the sphincters general tonics (iron, strychnine),
and local tonics (such as cold "sitz-baths," cold showers
and electric baths) may be used. Suppositories may also be
used to advantage in stimulating sphincter contractions and
accustoming the muscles to constrictive action.</p>

<p><i>Urine:</i> some defectives show involuntary loss of urine, especially
at night, up to very advanced ages. Epileptics are particularly
predisposed to this. The treatment is analogous to
that just described. Beverages should be carefully supervised.
Diuretics and excessive drinking in general should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>General recommendations:</i> Local baths, and rigorous cleanliness
to avoid any stimulus to onanism.</p>

<p>Education can do much in the treatment of this situation.
Urination should be regularly suggested to the child before he
goes to bed and when he wakes in the morning. In special
cases it might be well to waken the child once or twice during
the night for the same purpose. This defect is often associated
in a child with some abnormality in the phenomena of perspiration.</p>

<p><i>Perspiration:</i> The sweat has almost the same composition as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
urine, and perspiration is a process supplementary to the action
of the kidneys. It has been observed that often in defective
children perspiration is either entirely lacking or limited to
certain areas (the palms of the hands, the nose, etc.). It is
absolutely necessary to stimulate and regularize perspiration
over the whole surface of the body. This may be done by hot
and steam baths, by dry rubs with flannels (long sustained if
necessary), by woolen garments constantly worn next to the
skin, and other similar mechanical devices. We must, however,
absolutely avoid the use of special diaphoretic drugs, which
often bring about a fatal weakening of the organs of perspiration.
The treatments we have suggested above are, first of all,
harmless, but besides they contribute to the general toning and
sensitizing of the skin.</p>

<p><i>Nasal mucus and tears:</i> Tears are often lacking in defectives.
On the other hand nasal excretion is very abundant and
replaces the tears, which are often so rare that some children
reach a relatively advanced age without having wept. In such
cases there is a predisposition to certain diseases of the eyes;
and excessive nasal excretion prevents the functioning of the
olfactory organs.</p>

<p>For this we recommend inhaling of hot vapors and of fragrant
irritants, which correct the excessive excretion of mucus and
exercise the olfactory sense. Usually the regular secretion of
tears follows as a matter of course.</p>

<p><i>Saliva:</i> One of the most unpleasant abnormalities in defectives
is the continuous loss of saliva from "hanging lips."
But the effects are not only unesthetic. The continuous over-excretion
of saliva makes the inner organs of the mouth flabby
and swollen. The tongue and the organs of speech in general
gradually lose their contractive power, and articulation is ultimately
rendered impossible. Taste and tactile ability often
disappear altogether. Mastication becomes difficult and deglutition
irregular. The secondary effects on the digestive organs
are bad. We possess a variety of efficient curatives and educational
treatments for this defect: <i>first</i>, general tonics; <i>second</i>,
local cold douches on the lip muscles, electric massage of the
lips; <i>third</i>, the use of licorice sticks, large at first but gradually
reducing in diameter, to be introduced between the lips to stimulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the sucking activity and the exercise of the contractive
muscles. This will ultimately give the necessary muscular tone.
The lips of the child should be closed mechanically from time
to time to force him to swallow the saliva and to create the
habit of deglutition.</p></blockquote>


<h3>CLOTHING AND ENVIRONMENT</h3>

<blockquote><p>The principles of hygiene must be extended to the dress of
the child and to the environment in which it lives.</p>

<p><i>Clothing:</i> The child's clothes should be so made as to be
easily put on and off. They should not hinder normal functioning
of the body (breathing). They should afford no opportunity
for dangerous vices (onanism). If the child can dress
and undress without difficulty, it will learn the more readily to
look after itself even in those little necessities of daily life
where partial undressing is necessary. Special attention should
be given to stockings, which affect the development of sensitiveness
in the soles of the feet and also concern the process of
learning to walk.</p>

<p><i>Environment:</i> Just a few reminders: for defectives perfect
ventilation of course; but the walls and furniture should be
upholstered in the case of impulsive defectives or of defectives
who do not know how to walk. There is danger in furniture
with sharp projections and in toys which may be thrown about.
A "child's room," the luxury of which consists in it hygienic
location, its elastic walls, and its very emptiness, is the best
gift a rich family can make to the education of a defective
child.</p></blockquote>


<h3>MUSCULAR EDUCATION</h3>

<blockquote><p>Muscular education has for its object the bringing of the
individual to some labor useful for society. This labor must
always be executed by means of the muscles, whether it be manual
labor, speaking or writing. In a word, the intelligence must
subject the muscles to its own purposes and, that the muscles
may be equipped for such obedience, it is necessary to prepare
them by some education which will reduce them to coordination.
Muscular education in defectives accordingly has for its object
the stimulation and coordination of useful movements.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>It prepares: for exercise; for the activities of domestic service
(washing, dressing, preparing food, setting and clearing the
table, etc.); for manual labor (trades); for language (use of
the vocal organs). The preparation consists in bringing the
child to <i>tonic quiescence</i> in standing posture. The child must
learn first to stand still with head erect and with his eyes fixed
on the eyes of the teacher. From this position of <i>tonic quiescence</i>
we must pass to exercises in <i>imitation</i>. We obtain <i>tonic
quiescence</i> by a variety of procedures, the variation depending
upon individual cases. We must stimulate the apathetic and
the sluggish; we must moderate the hyperactive; we must correct
paresis, tics, etc. In other words, medical education must
precede pedagogy itself. It may be a question of applying medical
gymnastics both for active and passive movements, alternating
this treatment with massage, electric baths, etc.</p>

<p>Let us note one or two motor abnormalities which are easy to
detect in defectives. <i>Atony:</i> the child does not move; he cannot
stand; he cannot sit upright nor execute any movement
whatever. <i>Hyperactivity:</i> this is characterized by almost constant
<i>incoordinated</i> or disorganized movements which have no
useful purpose, e.g., jumping, beating, tearing up of objects
within reach and so on. Such patients are dangerous to themselves
and to others.</p></blockquote>


<h3>MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS</h3>

<blockquote><p>(A).&mdash;<i>Movements executed upon the person of the child:</i>
sucking of the fingers; biting of the nails; constant stroking of
some part of the body. These movements are caused by imperfectly
developed sensibility; the children stroke or caress, for
example, that area of the skin which possesses greatest tactile
sensitiveness, etc.</p>

<p>(B).&mdash;<i>Movements executed upon surrounding objects:</i> rapping
on tables; constant and careful tearing of pieces of paper
into small bits, etc. This too is associated with some sensory
pleasure on the part of the patient.</p>

<p><i>Rocking:</i> (a) <i>with patient reclining:</i> the head is nodded from
left to right, from right to left; (b) <i>with patient sitting:</i> the
trunk is rocked backward and forward; (c) <i>with patient standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>:</i>
the whole bod; rocks from left to right, the whole weight
resting now on one foot and now on the other. Difficulty and
hesitation are experienced in walking. These motory defects
proceed from the difficulty experienced by the child in finding his
center of gravity, his equilibrium.</p>

<p><i>Inability to perform local movements:</i> (a) Inability to move
certain of the fingers, the tongue, the lips, etc. From such defects
arises the impossibility of performing certain simple manual
exercises (bringing the finger tips of the two hands together;
taking hold of objects, e.g., inability to button, etc.) and
the inability to pronounce certain words; (b) Inability to contract
the lip and sphincter muscles (loss of saliva, involuntary
defecation).</p>

<p><i>Atony</i> and <i>hyperactivity</i> may be overcome by appropriate
educational remedies which we will now discuss. Local agitations
disappear with the general education of the senses; while
rocking is cured by exercises in balancing.</p>

<p>(A).&mdash;<i>Stimulate active movements in the atonic child until
he is able to stand erect in tonic quiescence.</i></p>

<p>Begin by stimulating the simple movements, gradually working
up to the most complicated. We have a sure guide for this
education in the spontaneous developments of movements in the
normal child: he begins with the easiest spontaneous movements
and gradually arrives at the harder ones.</p>

<p>The first movement which develops in the child is the <i>prehensile</i>
act (grasping). Next comes the movements of the lower
joints used in creeping and walking; next the ability to stand;
and finally the ability to walk alone. <i>Grasping:</i> if no external
stimulation is capable of interesting the defective of low type,
grasping cannot be stimulated merely by presenting to the child
some object or other which might seem to be interesting for
color taste or some other quality. In such a case we must have
recourse to the instinct of self-preservation, to that innate fear
of void which defectives almost always have. The child feeling
himself fall will instinctively grasp at some support within
his reach. This is the simplest point of departure for our possible
development of the grasping faculty in the defective child.</p>

<p><i>Method:</i> The hands of the child am mechanically fixed
around the rung of a ladder suspended to the ceiling. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the child in left to himself. Since his fingers are already around
the support he needs only to clench his hands to find support.
He may not succeed even in this simple act the first time. The
teacher must patiently repeat the exercise, always being ready,
of course, to catch the child if he should fall. In this exercise
the defective is very much alarmed as a rule and all his muscles
are as a result more or less stimulated.</p>

<p>Likewise based on the instinct of self-preservation is the
<i>swing</i>, where the defective must cling to some support with his
hands to keep from falling.</p>

<p>Finally a <i>ball</i> is hung from the ceiling and swung in such
a way as continually to strike the child in the face. To protect
himself he must keep it away by seizing it.</p>

<p>In still lower types we must have recourse to the instinct for
nutrition which exists even in such children.</p>

<p><i>Standing:</i> Under this heading we include also the movements
which precede the actual attainment of the standing
posture. To overcome the sinking of the knees, which impedes
standing, the <i>swinging chair</i> may be used. The seat must reach
nearly to the child's feet and the knees are tied to the seat.
The child's foot, as he swings, strike against a board. This
exercise prepares the lower joints to hold themselves in position
when resting on a plane surface. Next the child is placed
on <i>parallel bars</i>. The bars pass under the arm-pits and support
the child while his feet rest on the floor. In these exercises we
try to stimulate the movements which appear in walking (exercises
of the lower joints). Next we exercise the muscles which
support the spinal column. The child is made to sit down:
first the spine in upright against the back of the chair; finally
it remains upright when the support is removed. Little by
little walking can be produced if the child is taken away from
the bars and supported with a simple <i>gymnastic belt</i>. The exercise
is continued until he can be left entirely without support.</p>

<p>When the child has learned to walk we can <i>command</i> him to
stop in the position of <i>tonic quiescence</i>.</p>

<p>(B).&mdash;<i>Moderation of hyperactivity by forced quiescence.</i></p>

<p>In hyperactive children the arms must first be restrained by
holding them tight in our hands. The movements of the lower
limbs may be checked by holding the child's legs tight between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
our knees. Finally the child may be kept entirely quiescent
with his legs held between the teacher's knees, his arms in the
teacher's hands, with the trunk pushed back and held firmly
against the wall. By a similar process he can be kept quiet
while standing; then later in a position of <i>tonic quiescence</i>.</p>

<p><i>General Rule:</i> Exercises of the limbs beginning with the
arms should precede those specifically directed toward the spinal
column. Séguin says "<i>tonic quiescence</i> is necessarily the first
step from <i>atonic quiescence;</i> or if you wish, from a disordered
activity to an activity which represents harmony between the
muscular system and the mind."</p>

<p>We noted above that the posture of <i>tonic quiescence</i> involves
a fixity of gaze on the part of the child. This is the point of
departure for the development of coordinative movements and
<i>imitation</i> of what the child sees the teacher do.</p></blockquote>


<h3>EDUCATION OF THE FIXED GAZE</h3>

<blockquote><p>If the child is kept in the dark for some time and is suddenly
shown a bright light he will experience the sensation of <i>red</i>.</p>

<p>Keeping the child in a dark room for a shorter time a sudden
light will attract his gaze.</p>

<p>Move the light along the wall until the child's gaze follows it.</p>

<p>Next, in a light room, the child is shown a red cloth kept in
motion; a red balloon hung from the ceiling keeps striking him
in the face.</p>

<p>After these preparatory exercises the teacher can try to get
the child to fix its eyes on his own and to maintain the fixed
gaze. Here use may be made also of the sense of hearing
(words of command, encouragement, etc.).</p>

<p>Finally to obtain complete fixity of gaze, one may use the
large mirror, before which lights may be passed. There the
child can gaze at his own face and at the face of the teacher,
which will be kept motionless and which the child may come to
imitate.</p>

<p><i>Exercises of imitation:</i> (1) The child is taught to become
acquainted with himself. The various parts of his body are
pointed out to him and he is made to touch them. This continues
up to the point of distinguishing right from left. Begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
with the larger members of the body (arms, legs, trunk,
head) to be named in connection with movements of the whole
body. Then pass to the smaller members (the fingers, knuckles,
the organs of the mouth), to be referred to respectively in the
education of the hand and in the teaching of speech.</p>

<p>(2) The child is taught coordinative movements relating to
gymnastics (walking, running, jumping, pushing, etc.).</p>

<p>(3) Movements relating: (a) to the simpler forms of manual
labor (exercises of practical life: washing, dressing, picking up
and laying down various objects, opening and closing drawers);
(b) to more complex kinds of manual labor (elements of various
trades; weaving, Froebel exercises, etc.).</p>

<p>(4) Movements relating to articulate language. For this
educational process the following general rules are to be followed:
first, movements of the whole body must precede movements
of specific parts; second, only by analyzing complex movements
in their successive stages and by working out their details
point by point can we arrive at the execution of a perfect complex
movement.</p>

<p>This latter rule applies especially to manual education and
the teaching of language. When movements of the whole body
have been obtained it will often be necessary, before going on to
movements of particular members, to alternate the educational
cure with the medical: (1) to overcome the weakness of some
of the muscles (perhaps of some finger), use local electric baths,
passive gymnastics, etc.; (2) for retractions, retarded development
of aponeurosis of the palms, etc., use orthopedic treatment.</p>

<p>Gymnastics, manual labor, trades and speaking are special
branches of teaching, that usually require specially trained
teachers.</p></blockquote>


<h3>EDUCATION OF THE SENSES</h3>

<blockquote><p>Outline for examination.</p>

<p><i>Sight:</i> Sense of color. It is necessary to call the attention
of the child several times to the same color by presenting it
to him under different aspects and in different environments.
The stimulus should be strong. Other senses tend to associate
themselves with the chromatic sense, for example, the stereognostic
and gustatory senses. Whenever the teacher gives an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
<i>idea</i> she should unite with it the <i>word</i>, the only word which is
related to the idea. The words should be emphatically and distinctly
pronounced.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Pedagogical aprons:</i> The colors are presented on a large
moving surface, as for instance, an apron worn by the teacher;
e.g., a red apron. The teacher points to it, touches it, lifting
it with noticeable movements of the arms, continually calls the
attention of the child to it. "<i>Look! See here! Attention!</i>"
and so on; then saying in a low voice and slowly, "<i>This is</i> (and
then in a louder voice), <i>red, red, red!!!</i>" Now take two aprons,
one red, the other blue; repeat the same process for the blue.
There are three stages in the process of distinguishing between
colors: (a) "This is ... <i>red!</i>" (b) "Your apron is <i>red!</i>"
(c) "What color is this?" Then try three aprons, red, blue,
and yellow, bordered with white and black.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Insets</i>&mdash;color and form. The red circle, the blue square.
There are three stages: (a) "This is <i>red, red, red!</i> Touch
it! Do you feel? Your finger goes <i>all the way around, all the
way around</i>. It is <i>round</i>, it is <i>round, all round</i>. Put it in its
place!" (b) "Give me the <i>red</i> one!" (c) "What color is this
circle?"</p>

<p>(3) The dark room. A Bengal red color is shown: "It is
<i>red!</i>" The color appears behind a circular disc: "It is <i>red!</i>"
The blue is shown behind a square window: "It is <i>blue, blue,
blue</i>," etc.</p>

<p>(4) The child is given a circular tablet of red sugar to eat
and a square lump of blue sugar. He is made to smell a red
piece of cloth strongly scented with musk; or a blue piece of
cloth scented with asafetida, etc.</p>

<p>(5) The color chart.</p>

<p>(6) The first game of Froebel.</p>

<p>The first pedagogical material given should contain the color
already taught. The notion of color should be associated with
its original environment.</p>

<p><i>Shapes: Solids, Insets:</i> The procedure is always in the
three stages mentioned. (1) Show the object to the child. (2)
Have him recognize it. (3) Have him give it its name.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions:</i> Rods of the same thickness, but of graduated
length. First the longest and the shortest are shown. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
child is made to touch them and interchange them "Pick up
the <i>longest!</i>" "Place it on the table!" etc. Repeat this exercise,
adding some intermediate lengths; again finally, with all
the rods. Next the rods may be disarranged; the child is to
put them back in order of length. Notice whether the child
makes an accurate choice in the confused pile of the graduated
dimensions; or whether it is only by placing two rods together
that he comes to notice the difference between them. Notice
how long it is before the child makes an accurate choice in the
pile and of what degrees of difference in length he is accurately
aware.</p>

<p>Try the same exercise for <i>thickness:</i> prisms of equal length,
but of graduated thickness, using the same procedure in analogous
exercises. Games may be used for the estimation of distances.</p>

<p><i>The tactile sense proper:</i> One board with a corrugated surface
(like a grater) and one smooth. Another board with five
adjacent surfaces of graduated roughness. Similar exercises
may be used in the feeling of cloths (guessing games).</p>

<p>Games: The child is blindfolded and lightly tickled. He
must seize what is tickling him, putting his hand rapidly to the
irritant. ("Fly catching," a game for the localization of stimulants.)</p>

<p>The practise of the senses begins in the lower classes in the
form of guessing games; in the higher classes the education of
the senses is applied to exercises of practical life.</p>

<p><i>Hearing:</i> Empirical measurement of the acuteness of the
sense of hearing. Specimen game: the teacher about 35 feet
away from the blindfolded children and standing where an
object has been hidden, whispers the words "<i>Find it!</i>" Those
who have heard her will be able to find the object. Having
removed from the line the children who have heard, the teacher
steps to another place about a yard nearer and repeats the experiment
to the children who are left over, etc.</p>

Identify various musical instruments.<br />

Identify different human voices (of different people).<br />

Identify the voice of a man, a woman, a child.<br />

Recognize different people by their step, etc., etc.</div>

<p><i>Pitch:</i> Intervals of an octave, of a major triad, and so on;
major and minor chords. However, musical education requires
a separate chapter.</p>

<p><i>Sound projection, localization of sound in space:</i> The child
is blindfolded. The sound is produced; (1) in front of him;
behind him; to the right; to the left; above his head; (2) the
blindfolded child recognizes the relative distance at which the
sounds are produced; (3) the child decides from which side of
the room the sounds come; he is made to follow some one who
is speaking.</p>

<p><i>The horizontal plane:</i> This is the first notion imparted to
the child concerning his relationship to the objects about him.
Almost all the objects the child may perceive around him with
his senses rest on the horizontal plane: his table, his chair, and
so on. The very objects on which the child sits or puts his toys
are horizontal planes. If the plane were not horizontal, the
objects would fall, but they would strike on the floor which,
again, is a horizontal plane. Place an object on the child's
table and tip one end of the table to show him that the object
falls.</p>

<p><i>Guessing game for the plane surface:</i> This game serves to
fix the notion of the plane surface and at the same time trains
the eye and the attention of the child.</p>

<p>1. Under one of three aluminum cups is placed a small red
ball, a cherry or a piece of candy. The child must remember
under which cup the object is hidden. The teacher tries herself
and fails, always raising the empty cups and returning them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
their places. The child, however, finds the object immediately.</p>

<p>2. The teacher now begins to move the three cups about on the
plane surface. The child has to keep his eye on <i>his</i> cup and
never loses sight of it.</p>

<p>3. Repeat this exercise with six cups.</p>

<p><i>Checkerboard game:</i> This serves to teach the child the limits
and the various divisions of a plane. The squares are large
and in black and white. The whole board should be surrounded
by a border in relief. Various points are indicated on the plane:
forward, backward, right, left, center, by placing a tin soldier
at each point indicated. The soldiers may be moved about by
the child in obedience to directions of the teacher: "The officer
on horseback to <i>the center</i>": "Standard-bearer <i>to the right</i>,
etc.!" Finally, make all the soldiers advance toward the center
of the board over the black squares only; then over the
white squares only, etc.</p>

<p>These notions may be applied to exercises of practical life.
The children already know how to set the table without thinking
of what they are doing. From now on, the teacher may say:
"Put the plates on the <i>plane surface</i> of the tables!" "Put
the bottle <i>to the left!</i> <i>In the center!</i>" etc. Have a small table
set with little dishes, having the objects arranged in obedience
to commands of the teacher. After this, we may proceed to the
Froebel games on the plane surface with the cubes, blocks, and
so on.</p>

<p><i>Inset game as a preparation for reading, drawing, and writing:</i>
After the child knows the different colors and shapes in
the inset, the color tablets of the big inset can be put in place:
(1) on a piece of cardboard where the figures have been drawn
in shading in the respective colors; (2) on a cardboard where
the same figures have been drawn merely in colored outline
(linear abstraction of a regular figure).</p>

<p><i>Inset of shapes where the pieces are all of the same color
(blue):</i> The child recognizes the shape and puts the pieces in
place: (1) on a cardboard where the figure is shaded; (2) on a
cardboard where the figure is merely outlined (linear abstraction
of regular geometrical figures). Meanwhile, the child has
been touching the pieces: "The tablet is smooth. It turns
round and round and round. It is a <i>circle</i>. Here we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
<i>square</i>. You go this way and there is a <i>point;</i> this way, and
there is another point, and another, and another; there are <i>four
points!</i> In the <i>triangle</i> there are <i>three points!</i>" Then the
child follows with his finger the figures outlined on the cardboard.
"This one is entirely round: it is a <i>circle!</i> This one
has four points: it is a <i>square!</i> This one has three points: it
is a <i>triangle!</i>" The child runs over the same figures with a
small rod of wood (skewer), etc.</p></blockquote>


<h3>SIMULTANEOUS READING AND WRITING</h3>

<blockquote><p>At this point, we may bring in the chart with the vowels,
painted red. The child sees "irregular figures outlined in
color." Give the child the vowels made of red wood.  He is
to place them on the corresponding figures of the chart.  He is
made to touch the wooden vowels, running his finger around
them in the way they are written. They are called by their
names. The vowels are arranged according to similarity in
shape (reading):</p>

<div class='center'>
o e a<br />
i u<br />
</div>

<p>Then the child is commanded: "Show me the letter <i>o!</i> Put
it in its place!" Then he is asked: "What letter is this?"
It will be found at this point that many children make a mistake,
if they merely look at the letter, but guess rightly when
they touch it. It is possible accordingly to distinguish the various
individual types, visual, motory, etc.</p>

<p>Next the child is made to touch the letter outlined on the
chart, first with his forefinger only, then with the fore and middle
fingers, finally with a little wooden skewer to be held like a
pen. The letter must always be followed around in the way it
is written.</p>

<p>The consonants are drawn in blue and arranged on various
charts, according to similarity in shape (reading, writing).
The movable alphabet in blue wood is added to this. The letters
are to be superimposed on the chart as was done for the
vowels. Along with the alphabet we have another series of
charts, where, beside the consonant identical with the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
letter there are painted one or more figures of objects, the names
of which begin with the letter in question. Beside the long-hand
letter, there is also painted in the same color a smaller
letter in print type. The teacher, naming the consonants in
the phonic method, points to the letter, then to the chart, pronouncing
the name of the objects which are painted there, and
stressing the first letter: e.g., "m ... man ... m: Give me
<i>M!</i>" "Put it where it belongs!" "Follow around it with
your finger!" Here the linguistic defects of the children may
be studied.</p>

<p>The tracing of the letters in the way they are written begins
the muscular education preparatory to writing. One of our
little girls of the motory type when taught by this method reproduced
all the letters in pen and ink long before she could
identify them. Her letters were about eight millimetres high
and were written with surprising regularity. This same child
was generally successful in her manual work.</p>

<p>The child, in looking at the letters, identifying them, and
tracing them in the way they are written, is preparing himself
both for reading and writing at the same time. The two processes
are exactly contemporaneous. Touching them and looking
at them brings several senses to bear on the fixing of the
image. Later the two acts are separated: first looking (reading),
then touching (writing). According to their respective
type, some children learn to read first, others to write first.</p>

<p><i>Reading:</i> As soon as the child has learned to identify the
letters and also to write them, he is made to pronounce them.
Then the alphabet is arranged in phonetic order. This order is
to be varied according to individual defects made apparent
while the child is pronouncing spontaneously the sounds of the
consonants or vowels, or the words illustrating the consonants
on the charts. We begin by showing the child and having him
pronounce, first, syllables and, then, words which contain the
letters he is able to pronounce well. Then we go on to the
sounds he has trouble with, finally to those he cannot pronounce
at all (linguistic correction). The phonomimic correction of
speech requires special discussion. In primary schools speech
correction should be in the hands of a specially trained teacher,
like gymnastics, manual training and singing. Should no defects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
in speech appear in the child, the letters of the alphabet
should be taught in the order of physiological phonetics.</p>

<p>Beside the big long-hand letters should be placed the small
letters in print type. The letter is taught; then recognition is
prompted by asking as each large letter is reached: "I want
the little one like it." The two types of letter appear also on
the illustrated charts. Next the printed letter is shown, with
the request: "Give me the big letter that goes with it."
Finally: "What letter is it?" The little letters are not
"touched," because they are never to be written.</p></blockquote>


<h3>DRAWING AND WRITING</h3>

<blockquote><p>The child is given a sheet on which appear a circle and a
square in outline. The circle is filled in with a red pencil, the
square with blue (insets). Smaller and smaller circles are next
given, also circles and triangles. They are variously disposed
on the page. They are to be filled in with colored pencils.
Then comes the tracing. The black lines are followed around
with colored pencils: the circle, the triangle, the square. This
comes easily to the child who has been taught to trace with
the wooden skewer the figures outlined on the inset-charts.
Writing follows immediately on the exercises in tracing with
the skewer on the charts of the written alphabet. Some help
can be given the child by having him darken with a black pencil
the letter written on the copy book by the teacher. As the
child writes, his attention should be directed to the fact that
he is writing on a <i>limited plane surface;</i> that he begins at the
top, moving from left to right and little by little coming down
the page.</p>

<p>Séguin's method began with shafts and curves. His copybooks
for the shafts were prepared as follows: the shaft to be
executed by the child was delimited by two points, connected
by a very light line. In the margin of the pages appear two
shafts to be executed by the teacher. Similarly for the curves:
( ( ( (. He has the printed capitals drawn as combinations
of shafts and curves: B, D, etc.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>


<h3>SIMULTANEOUS READING AND WRITING OF WORDS</h3>

<blockquote><p>The child, through sensory education, has acquired some notions
of color, shape, surface (smooth and rough), smell, taste,
etc. At the same time, he has learned to count (one, two, three,
four points). Uniting all possible notions concerning a single
object, we arrive at his first concrete idea of the object itself:
the object lesson. To the idea thus acquired, we give the word
which represents the object. Just as the concrete idea results
from the assembling of acquired notions, so the word results
from the union of known sounds, and perceived symbols.</p>

<p><i>Reading lesson:</i> On the teacher's table is the large stand for
the movable alphabet in black printed letters. The teacher
arranges on it the vowels and a few consonants. Each child, in
his own place, has the small movable alphabet in the pasteboard
boxes. The children take from the box the same letters they
see on the large stand, and arrange them in the same order.
The teacher takes up some object which has a simple word for
a name, e.g., <i>pane</i> ("bread"). She calls the attention of the
child to the object, reviewing an objective lesson already learned,
thus arousing the child's interest in the object. "Shall we
write the word <i>pane?</i>" "<i>Hear</i> how I say it!" "<i>See</i> how I
say it!" The teacher pronounces separately and distinctly the
sounds of the letters which make up the word, exaggerating the
movements of the vocal organs so that they are plainly visible to
the children. As the pupils repeat the word they continue
their education in speaking.</p>

<p>A child now comes to the teacher's desk to choose the letters
corresponding to the sounds and tries to arrange them in the
order in which they appear in the word. The children do the
same with the small letters at their seats. Every mistake gives
rise to a correction useful to the whole class. The teacher repeats
the word in front of each one who has made a mistake,
trying to get the child to correct himself. When all the children
have arranged their letters properly, the teacher shows a
card (visiting-card size) on which is printed (in print-type
letters about a centimeter high) the word "<i>pane</i>." All the
children are made to read it. Then some child is asked to put
the card where he finds the word written before him; next, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the <i>object</i> the word stands for. The process is repeated with
two or three other objects, with their respective names: <i>pane</i>
(bread), <i>lume</i> (lamp), <i>cece</i> (peas). Then the teacher gathers
up the cards from the various objects, shuffles them and calls
on some child: "Which object do you like best?" "<i>Lume!</i>"
"Find me the card with the word <i>lume!</i>" When the card has
been selected, all the children are asked to read it: "Is Mary
right in saying that this is the word <i>lume?</i>" "Put the card
back where it belongs!" (i.e., on its object). In the subsequent
lessons, the old cards, with the objects they stand for removed,
should be mixed with the new ones. From the entire pack the
children are to select the new cards and place them on their
objects. A primary reading book ought to present these words
next to a picture of the object for which they stand.</p>

<p>In this way the children are brought to unite the individual
symbol into words. When they have been taught to make the
syllable, the reading lesson may be continued without the use
of objects, though it is still preferable to use words which will,
if possible, have a concrete meaning for the children.</p>

<p><i>Writing:</i> The children are already able to use the cursive
(writing) alphabet which corresponds to the small letter (print-type)
that is neither "touched" nor written, but is merely <i>read</i>.
They must now write in hand writing, and place close together,
the little letters which they have assembled in the movable
alphabet to compose words. As each word is read or written
for every object lesson, for every action, printed cards are being
assembled which will later be used to make clauses and sentences
with movable words that may be moved about just as
the individual letters were moved about in making the <i>words</i>
themselves. Later on, the simple clauses or sentences should
refer to actions performed by the children. The first step
should be to bring two or more words together: e.g., <i>red-wool</i>,
<i>sweet-candy</i>, <i>four-footed dog</i>, etc. Then we may go on to the
sentence itself: <i>The wool is red;</i> <i>The soup is hot;</i> <i>The dog has
four feet;</i> <i>Mary eats the candy</i>, etc. The children first compose
the sentences with their cards; then they copy them in
their writing books. To facilitate the choice of the cards, they
are arranged in special boxes: for instance, one box is labeled
<i>noun:</i> or its compartments are distinguished thus: <i>food</i>, <i>clothing</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
<i>animals</i>, <i>people</i>, etc. There should be a box for <i>adjectives</i>
with compartments for <i>colors</i>, <i>shapes</i>, <i>qualities</i>, etc. There
should be another for <i>particles</i> with compartments for <i>articles</i>,
<i>conjunctions</i>, <i>prepositions</i>, etc. A box should be reserved for
<i>actions</i> with the label <i>verbs</i> above; and then in a compartment
should be reserved for the <i>infinitive</i>, <i>present</i>, <i>past</i> and
<i>future</i> respectively. The children gradually learn by practice
to take their cards from the boxes and put them back in their
proper places. They soon learn to know their "word boxes"
and they readily find the cards they want among the <i>colors</i>,
<i>shapes</i>, <i>qualities</i>, etc., or among <i>animals</i>, <i>foods</i>, etc. Ultimately
the teacher will find occasion to explain the meaning of the big
words at the top of the drawers, <i>noun</i>, <i>adjective</i>, <i>verb</i>, etc., and
this will be the first step into the subject of <i>grammar</i>.</p></blockquote>


<h3>GRAMMAR</h3>


<div class='subsection'>NOUN LESSON</div>

<blockquote><p>We may call persons and objects by their <i>name</i> (their <i>noun</i>).
People answer if we call them, so do animals. Inanimate objects,
however, never answer, because they cannot; but if they
could answer they would; for example, if I say <i>Mary</i>, Mary
answers; if I say <i>peas</i>, the peas do not answer, because they
cannot. You children <i>do</i> understand when I call an object and
you bring it to me. I say for example, <i>book</i>, <i>beans</i>, <i>peas</i>. If
I don't tell you the name of the object you don't understand
what I am talking about; because every object has a different
name. This name is the word that stands for the object. This
name is a <i>noun</i>. When I mention a noun you understand immediately
the object which the noun represents: <i>tree</i>, <i>chair</i>,
<i>pen</i>, <i>book</i>, <i>lamb</i>, etc. If I do not give this noun, you don't
know what I am talking about; for, if I say simply, <i>Bring me
... at once, I want it</i>, you do not know what I want, unless I
tell you the name of the object. Unless I give you the <i>noun</i>,
you do not understand. Thus every object is represented by a
word which is its <i>name</i> and this name is a <i>noun</i>. To understand
whether a word is a noun or not, you simple ask "Is it a thing?"
"Would it answer if I spoke to it!" "Could I carry it to the
teacher?" For instance, <i>bread</i>. Yes, <i>bread</i> is an object; <i>table</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
yes, it is an object; <i>conductor</i>, yes, the conductor would answer,
if I were to speak to him.</p>

<p>Let us look through our cards now. I take several cards
from different boxes and shuffle them. Here is the word <i>sweet</i>.
Bring me <i>sweet</i>. Is there anything to answer when I call
<i>sweet?</i> But you are bringing me a piece of candy! I didn't
say <i>candy:</i> I said <i>sweet!</i> And now you have given me sugar!
I said <i>sweet</i>. If I say <i>candy</i>, <i>sugar</i>, then you understand what
I want, what object I am thinking about, because the words
<i>candy</i>, <i>sugar</i>, stand for objects. Those words are <i>nouns</i>. Now
let us look through the noun cards. Let us read a couple of
lines in our reading books and see whether there are any nouns
there. Tell me, are there any nouns? How are we to find
some nouns? Look around you! Look at yourself, your clothes,
etc.! Name every object that you see! Every word you thus
pronounce will be a noun: Teacher, clothing, necktie, chair,
class, children, books, etc. Just look at this picture which represents
so many things! The figures represent persons and objects.
Name each of these figures! Every word you pronounce
will be a noun!</p></blockquote>


<div class='subsection'>VERB: ACTION</div>

<blockquote><p>Mary, rise from your seat! Walk! Mary has performed a
number of <i>actions</i>. She has <i>risen</i>. She has performed the
<i>action</i> of rising. She has <i>walked</i>. <i>Walk</i> stands for an action.
Now write your name on the blackboard! <i>Writing</i> is an action.
Erase what you have written. <i>Erasing</i> is an action. When I
spoke to Mary, I performed the action of speaking. (Just as
the noun was taught with objects, here we must have actions.
Objects represented in pictures will be of no use, since actions
cannot be portrayed by pictures.)</p>

<p>The next step will be to suggest a little exercise of imagination.
Look at all these objects! Try to imagine some action
which each might perform! A <i>class</i>, for instance; what actions
might a class perform? <i>Store:</i> what actions might take place
in a store? Let us now look through our cards after we have
shuffled them. Next try our reading book. Show me which of
the words are verbs. Give me some words which are verbs
(infinitive).</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>


<div class='subsection'>NOUN</div>

<blockquote><p>Persons, things (proper and common nouns). Singular,
plural, masculine and feminine. The articles: "Choose the
article that goes with this noun!" etc.</p></blockquote>


<div class='subsection'>VERB</div>

<blockquote><p>Present, past, future. I am performing an action now. Have
I performed it before? Did I do it yesterday? Have I always
done it in the past? When I walk now, I say I <i>am walking</i>,
I <i>walk</i>. When I mean the action that I performed yesterday,
I say: I <i>was walking</i>, I <i>walked</i>. The same action performed
at different times is described differently. How strange that is!
The word referring to an object never changes. The beads are
beads to-day. They were beads yesterday. <i>Actions</i>, however,
are represented by words which change according to the time
in which they are performed. To-day I <i>walk</i>. Yesterday I
<i>walked</i>. To-morrow I <i>shall walk</i>. It is always <i>I</i> who do the
walking, <i>I</i> who perform the <i>action</i> of walking; and I walk always
in the same way, putting one foot in front of the other.
The objects you see perform an action always perform it. Do
you see that little bird which is flying&mdash;which is performing
the <i>action</i> of flying? It was flying yesterday. It flew at some
time in the past. To-morrow also, that is, at some <i>future</i> time,
if the little bird lives, it will fly and it will fly always in the
same way, beating its wings to and fro. You see what a strange
thing a verb is! It changes its words according to the <i>time</i>
in which the action is performed. It is different according as
it represents action in <i>present</i> time, or action in <i>past</i> time, or
action in <i>future</i> time. Now, see! I am going to take out some
of my cards and make up a little sentence:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/i_449.jpg" width="382" height="51" alt="cards" />
</div>

<p>Now I am going to change the word which stands for the time
when the action takes place. In place of the card <i>now</i> I am
going to use this one:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/i_450.jpg" width="98" height="43" alt="card" />
</div>


<p>Is this a good sentence? No! Supposing we change the time
of the verb: <i>Yesterday George ate an apple</i>. This makes good
sense. Put these cards back now in the boxes where they belong.</p></blockquote>


<div class='subsection'>ADJECTIVE</div>

<blockquote><p>Every object possesses certain <i>qualities</i>. Tell me what you
can about this apple. It is red, it is round, it is sweet. What
qualities can you find in this chair? It is hard, it is brown,
it is wooden. What about your school-mates, the children?
Are they good, are they pretty, are they polite, are they obedient,
or are they naughty, impolite, disobedient, disorderly?
Let us look through our cards to see whether we can find words
which stand for the qualities of objects. Supposing we select
some from the drawer of the adjective and some from the
drawer of the noun. Now let us place beside each noun a
card which makes sense with it: here, for instance, I have
<i>Charles</i>, <i>red</i>, <i>quadruped</i>, <i>transparent</i>. Does that mean anything?
Well then find me some adjectives which will go well
with <i>Charles</i>. Adjectives are words which stand for qualities
of a given object. They must go well with their noun. Find
me some adjectives which fit well with the noun <i>dog</i>. They
must be words which stand for some quality of the dog. Now
put all the cards back in the compartments where they belong.
(This latter exercise is very instructive.)</p>

<p>In this method of teaching grammar we make use of objects
and actions directly relating to life. Such lessons may be made
more attractive with story telling, etc. The teaching of grammar
at this period should be extended as far as is possible without
forcing the pupil.</p></blockquote>


<h3>OBJECT LESSONS</h3>

<blockquote><p>There should be concise and vivid descriptions of some object.
The attention of the child should be sustained by changing
the tone of voice, by exclamations calculated to excite the
child's curiosity, by praise, etc. Never begin with the <i>word</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
but always with the <i>object</i>. All the notions possessed by the
child should be as far as practicable in a given case applied to
his study of the object. First it should be described as to its
qualities; next as to its uses, then as to its origin; for example,
Here is an <i>object!</i> What color is it? What is its shape?
Feel of it! Taste of it! etc. If possible, have the child <i>see</i>
the use of the object and its origin in every possible way. Just
as the concrete idea of the object is imparted by verbal description
and by various appeals to the senses of the child, so the
different uses of the object should be brought out in <i>describing
actions</i> which the child <i>sees</i> performed with it before him.
This, of course, is an ideal which the teacher should try to
realize as far as possible. The object should be shown the child
in different circumstances and under different aspects so as to
give it always the appearance of something new and something
to excite and hold the attention of the child. Take, for instance,
a lesson on the word <i>hen</i>. Show a paper model of the
hen, the live hen in the courtyard, the stereopticon slide of the
hen; the print of the hen in the reading book; the hen alive
among other domestic fowls; pictures of the hen among pictures
of other birds, etc. Each new step should be taken on a
different day and each time the word should be connected with
the object. Write the word on the blackboard; make up the
printed card for the card file and put it in its proper box.
"Who wants to take the blackboard out-doors? We are going
to write some words in the yard. Now in your reading books
there is the figure of the hen. Next to it is the word <i>hen</i>.
Write this word in your copy books. Who can repeat what we
have said about the hen? Write down what you know about
the hen." The amount of information given about a particular
object will depend, of course, upon the class. The simplest description
should be followed by one more minute, passing thus
to speak of uses, habits, origin, etc. The writing of a simple
word may be developed into a written description. But the
lessons on the given object should always be short, and they
should be repeated on different days. For the lessons on trees,
plants, and vegetables, a garden is necessary: the children
should see the seeds planted, a growing vegetable, a picture
of the fruit, etc. If possible the domestic use of the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
products should be demonstrated. This applies also to flowers.
The blackboard with crayon should never be lacking in the
garden. For object lessons we need toys to represent furniture,
dishes, various objects used in the home, tools of different
trades, rooms and the furniture that goes in each, houses, trees,
a church (to build villages), etc.; dolls equipped with all the
necessaries for dressing. There should be a shelf for bottles
containing specimens of different drinks; various kinds of
cloths (for tactile exercises); the raw materials out of which
they are made, demonstrations of the way they are manufactured,
etc. Show also specimens of the various minerals, etc.</p></blockquote>


<h3>HISTORY</h3>

<blockquote><p>History is taught first on a little stage with living tableaux,
gradually advancing to action; second, by descriptions of large
illustrations and colored pictures; third, by story-telling based
on stereopticon views. The teacher should strive for brevity,
conciseness, and vivacity in descriptions. Historical story telling
should, as in the case of all other lessons, bring about additions
of printed cards to the word boxes. Various information
of the seasons, months of the year, etc., should be imparted by
illustrations and pictures. Every morning the child should be
asked: "What day is it? What day was yesterday? What
day will to-morrow be?" and "What day of the month is it?"</p></blockquote>


<h3>GEOGRAPHY</h3>

<blockquote><p>1. Exercises on the plane for the cardinal points, with various
gymnastic and guessing games. 2. Building games out of
doors. Make a lake, an island, a peninsula, a river. 3. Carry
the houses and church into the yard and construct a small village.
Put the church on the north; the schoolhouse on the
east; the mountain on the west; in front of the school place
the national flag. 4. In the classroom fit out a room with its
proper furniture to be placed on a map of the room outlined
on a large chart. As the furniture is removed, make a mark
on the map to indicate where each article was. Make a little
village in the same way, houses, church, etc. Take away the
church, etc.; mark the place of each object on the map as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
removed. Then identify each spot. "Where was the church?"
"What was over here?" etc. Thus we get a conception of the
geographical map. Read the map, making use of the cardinal
points. 5. Physical characteristics of regions may be shown
by clay modeling to represent hills, etc. Draw outlines around
each model, remove the clay and read the <i>geographical map</i>
resulting.</p></blockquote>


<h3>ARITHMETIC</h3>

<blockquote><p>The children are to count: 1 nose; 1 mouth; 1, 2 hands;
1, 2 feet; 1, 2, 3, 4 points in the insets; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 soldiers
on the plane. How many blocks did they use in the building?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Thus for the elementary steps in counting.</p></blockquote>


<h3>COMPUTATION</h3>

<blockquote><p>Computation should be taught practically in the store from
the very beginning. The shopkeeper sells 1 cherry for 1c. The
children have 2c and get two cherries. Next they get two nuts
for 1c. Place 1c on the counter and place 2 nuts beside it.
Then count all the nuts and there are 2 for 1c, etc. The child
must give him 1c in change (2 + 2 = 4; 2 - 1 = 1). In
money changing it will be observed that at first some children
recognize the coins more easily by touch than by sight (motor
types).</p></blockquote>


<h3>WRITTEN NUMBERS</h3>

<blockquote><p>Charts with the nine numbers: one for each number. Each
chart has picture representing quantities of the most varied
objects arranged around the number, which is indicated by a
large design on the chart. For instance: on the <i>1</i> card there is
one cherry, one dog, one ball, etc. Yesterday the shopkeeper
sold one cherry for 1c. Is the cherry here? Yes, there is the
cherry! And what is this? <i>One</i> church! And this? <i>One</i>
cent! etc. What is this figure here? It is the number <i>one</i>.
Now bring out the wooden figure: What is this? Number
<i>one!</i> Put it on the figure on the chart! It is <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>Now take the charts to the store. Who has 1c? Who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
2c? etc. Let us look for the number among the charts. The
shopkeeper is selling three peas for 1c. Let us look for number
<i>3</i> among the charts! Numbers should be taught in the
afternoon lesson in the store. The designs representing the
figures should be shown the following morning. Next time the
charts with the figures previously taught should be taken to
the shop to be recognized again. Other numbers are brought
out in the new computations. The figures for the new numbers
then taught in the store should be shown the following day, etc.
To make the store interesting, the topic lesson on the objects
offered for sale should be frequently repeated. The child should
be taught to buy only perfect objects, so that on receiving them
he may examine them carefully, observing them in all their
parts. He should give them back if they are not perfect or if
mistakes are made by the shopkeeper in giving them out. For
instance: A spoiled apple should not be accepted. "I refuse
to buy it!" Beans should not be accepted for peas. Again
the child refuses to buy them. He must pay only when he is
sure he has been served properly (exercise in practical life).</p>

<p>The storekeeper will make mistakes: first, in <i>kinds</i> of objects,
to sharpen the observation of <i>qualities</i> by the children who
purchase; second, in the <i>number</i> of objects given, to accustom
the child to purchasing proper <i>quantities</i>.</p></blockquote>


<h3>ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS</h3>

<blockquote><p>Even numbers are red. Odd numbers are blue. There are:
movable figures in wood; red and blue cubes in numbers corresponding
to the figures on them; finally, charts with numbers
drawn in color. Under each design are small red and blue
squares arranged in such a way as to emphasize the divisibility
of <i>even</i> numbers by 2 and similarly the indivisibility by 2 of
<i>odd</i> numbers. In the latter case one square is always left by
itself in the center.</p>




<div class="center">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>The child places the movable numbers and the cubes on the
figures on the charts. The teacher then makes two equal rows
of cubes to correspond to the even numbers (red). The division
is easy! But try to separate the odd numbers (blue). It
is not possible! A block is always left in the middle! The
child takes the figures and the blocks and arranges them on his
table, imitating the design on the chart. He tries to make two
equal rows of cubes for the even numbers. He succeeds. He
does not succeed in doing so with the odd numbers. The numbers
which can be divided thus are <i>even;</i> those which cannot
be so divided are <i>odd</i>.</p>

<p><i>Number boxes:</i> On these boxes are designed red and blue
figures identical with those on the charts. The child puts into
each box the number of cubes called for by the figure on the
box. This exercise follows immediately the work on odd and
even numbers described above. As the child transfers each
series of cubes from his table to the boxes, he pronounces the
number and adds <i>odd</i> or <i>even</i>.</p>

<p><i>Exercises in attention and memory:</i> A chart of odd and
even numbers in colors is placed on the teacher's desk in view
of all the children. The red and blue cubes are piled on the
teacher's desk. The teacher passes the wooden figures to the
children and tells them to examine them. Immediately afterwards
the children leave their seats, go to the teacher's desk,
and get the numbers which correspond to their own figures.
On going back to their places they fit the cubes under the corresponding
figure in the arrangement just learned. The teacher
is to observe</p>

<div class='hang2'>1. Whether the child has remembered the color of his figure
(frequently a child with a red number takes the blue
cubes).</div>

<div class='hang2'>2. Whether he has remembered his <i>number</i>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3. Whether he remembers the proper arrangement.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4. Whether the child remembers that the chart from which
he <i>can copy</i> is before him on the stand and whether he
thinks of looking at it.</div>

<p>When mistakes are made, the teacher has the child correct himself
by calling his attention to the chart.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>


<div class='subsection'>COUNTING BY TENS<br />

(<i>For more advanced classes</i>)</div>

<blockquote><p>In the store ten objects are sold for one cent, e.g.:</p>

<p>(10 beans), one cent for each <i>ten</i>.</p>

<p>One ten = ten, 10.</p>

<p>Two tens = twenty, 20.</p>

<p>Three tens = thirty, 30, etc.</p>

<p>From forty on (in English from sixty on) the numbers are
more easily learned because their names are like simple numbers
with the ending -<i>ty</i> (Italian -<i>anta</i>).</p>

<p>Charts should be prepared (rectangular in shape) on which
nine tens appear arranged one under the other; then nine cards
where each ten is repeated nine times in a column; finally,
numerous cards with the unit figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, to be
fitted on the zeros on the cards where the tens are repeated nine
times.</p>

<div class='list1'>
10&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
20&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
30&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
40&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
50&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
60&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
70&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
80&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
90&mdash;10&mdash;20<br />
</div>

<p>Some difficulty will be experienced with the tens where the
names do not correspond to the simple numbers: 11, 12, 13, etc.
The other tens, however, will be very easy. When a little child
is able to count to 20, he can go on to 100 without difficulty.
The next step is to superimpose the little cards on the first
chart of the tens series, having the resultant numbers read
aloud.</p>

<p><i>Problems:</i> Problems are, at first, simple memory exercises
for the children. In fact the problems are solved practically in
the store in the form of a game; buying, lending, sharing with
their schoolmates, taking a part of what is bought and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
it to some other child, etc. The store exercises should be repeated
in the form of a problem on the following morning.
The children have simply to remember what happened and reproduce
it in writing. <i>Problems are next developed contemporaneously</i>
with the various arithmetical operations and computations
(addition, multiplication, etc.). The teacher explains
the operations starting with the problem, which becomes for the
children a very amusing game. The problem, finally, becomes
an imaginative exercise: "Suppose you are going to the store
to buy," etc., etc. We can ultimately arrive at real problems
that require reasoning. In the store the teacher illustrates the
various operations on the blackboard, using simple marks at
first: "You have bought 2c worth of beans, at three for a cent.
Let us write that down: III&mdash;III. Then let us count.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are six.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="math">
<tr>
<td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">III III</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Well, then,&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">3 + 3</td>
<td align="left">&nbsp;= 6.</td>
</tr>

</table></div>

<div class='unindent'>We can
also say: 2 groups of III equals 6; twice, three, six; two times
three, six; 2 × 3 = 6. How much is 3 + 3? How much is
2 × 3? How much is 3 × 2?"</div>

<p>The following morning, when the written problem is given,
the child should have before him for reference the computation
charts with all the combinations possible.</p>

<p>The transition to mental computation will come after this
and not before.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Subtraction in the same way. The development of these various
operations followed logically on the practical exercise in
the store, where multiplication proved to be a product of sums,
division, a process of successive subtractions.</p>

<p>In our classes we have arithmetic lessons every day. The
afternoon practice in the store prepares for the theoretical lesson
of the following morning. Accordingly, on the day when
the practical exercise occurs, there is no theoretical lesson and
vice versa.</p>

<p>The decimal metric system applied to weights, measures and
coinage is taught in the same way. The store should be
equipped with scales, weights, dry and liquid measures, etc. All
kinds of coins should be available, including bills up to $20
(100 francs). Work in the store should continue to be not only
a help toward arithmetical computation but also toward the
preparation for practical life. For instance, when cloth is sold,
some attention should be given to its actual market value; its
qualities should be emphasized by feeling, etc.; and the child
should be taught to observe whether the storekeeper has given
him the right amount and the right quality. Money changing
should be made ready and easy. The money which the children
spend at the store should be earned by them as a reward
for their application to study and their good behavior.</p></blockquote>


<h3>GENERAL RULES</h3>

<blockquote><p>To attract the attention of defective children strong sensory
stimulants are necessary. The lessons, therefore, should be
eminently practical. Every lesson should begin with the presentation
of the object to be illustrated by the teacher in a few
words distinctly pronounced with continual modulations of the
voice and accompanied by vivid imitative expression. The lessons
should be made as attractive as possible and, as far as practicable,
presented under the form of games, so as to arouse the
curiosity of the child: guessing games, blindman's buff, store-keeping,
the sleep walker, the blind store-keeper, etc. But however
amusing the game may be, the lesson should always be
stopped while the child is still willing to continue. His attention,
which is easily fatigued, should never be exhausted. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
fix ideas, lessons should be repeated many times. Each time,
however, the same objects should be presented under different
forms and in a different environment, so that it will always be
interesting by appearing as something new: story-telling, living
tableaux, large illustrations; colored pictures; stereopticon
views, etc. In case individual teaching is necessary, as happens
in the most elementary classes, care should be exercised to keep
all the other children busy with different toys: insets, lacing-and-buttoning-frames,
hooks and eyes, etc. When children refuse to
take part in their lessons it is better not to use coercion, but to
aim at obtaining obedience indirectly through the child's imitation
of his schoolmates. Glowing praise of the pupils who are
showing good will in their work almost always brings the recalcitrants
to time. When a child shows he has understood
the point under discussion, it is better not to ask for a repetition.
His attention is easily fatigued, and the second time he
may say badly what at first he gave successfully; and the failure
may discourage him. It is well to be satisfied with the first
good answer, bestow such praise as will afford the child a pleasant
memory of what he has been doing; and go back to the subject
on the following day, or, at the earliest, several hours
later.</p>

<p>In manual training, however, the situation is different. The
lesson in this subject can be a whole hour long and should take
the form of serious work and not of play. The child should
be set early at some useful task, even if a little hard work, not
unattended with risk, be involved (wood-cutting, boring, etc.).
From the outset, thus, the child will become familiar with the
difficulties of bread-winning effort and will learn to overcome
them.</p>

<p>Interest in work may be stimulated by appropriate rewards.
The child may earn during work-hours the money for his purchases
at the store, for his tickets to the theater and the
stereopticon lecture. The child who does not work may be
kept away from the more attractive lessons, such as dancing
and music, which come immediately after the work hour. As
a matter of fact, these children take to manual training very
readily, provided the tasks assigned are adapted to the natural
inclinations of the individual child in such a way that he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
take in his work the greatest possible satisfaction and thus by
natural bent attain a skill useful to himself and society.</p></blockquote>


<h3>MORAL EDUCATION</h3>

<blockquote><p>By the expression "moral education" we mean an education
which tends to make a social being of an individual who is by
nature extra- or anti-social. It presents two aspects which may
be paralleled with the education thus far treated and which we
call "intellectual education."</p>

<p>In this latter training of the mind, we began by an appropriate
hygienic cure of all those physical defects which could
stand in the way of successful mental education. In moral
education, likewise, we try to eliminate such defects as arise
from some passing physical ailment. We should carefully consider
the apparently causeless "naughtiness" of children, to see
whether it may not be due to some intestinal disturbance, or to
the early stages of some infectious disease. The symptoms of
such diseases should be known to the teacher. I have been told
that English mothers use the empirical method of administering
purgatives or cold shower baths to "naughty children," often
with good correctional effect. I suggest that such empiricism is
hardly prudent where science is able to prescribe much safer
and more efficacious methods. Child hygiene must be well
known to the educator and should be the pivotal point of every
educational system.</p>

<p>In mental education, we began by reducing the child to <i>tonic
quiescence;</i> here we must begin by reducing the child to <i>obedience</i>.</p>

<p>In mental education, to give the child his first notions of
his physical person (personal imitation: touching of the parts
of the body) and of his relations to environment (personal imitation:
moving of objects, etc.) we had recourse to <i>imitation;</i>
here, to instil in the child elementary notions of his duties, we
must throw around the child an atmosphere morally correct, an
environment in which, after attaining obedience, he can <i>imitate</i>
persons who act properly.</p>

<p>In mental education we went on to the training of the senses;
here we pass to the education of <i>feelings</i>. Our next step, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
the one case, was to the education proper of the mind; here it
is to the training of the will.</p>

<p>The parallel is perfect:</p>

<div class='indent'>
hygienic training: hygiene;<br />
<i>tonic quiescence:</i> obedience;<br />
imitation: imitation (environment);<br />
sensory education: education of the feelings (sensibilities);<br />
mental education proper: education of the will.<br />
</div></blockquote>


<h3>OBEDIENCE</h3>

<blockquote><p>In a command the will of the teacher is imposed upon the
defective child who is lacking in will. The will of the teacher
is substituted for the child's will in impelling to action or inhibiting
the child's impulses. From the very first the child must
feel this will, which is imposed upon him and is irrevocably
destined to overcome him. The child must understand that
against this will he cannot offer any resistance. The teacher's
command must be obeyed at whatever cost, even if coercive
measures must be resorted to. No consideration should ever
lead the teacher to desist from enforcing her command. The
child <i>must</i> submit and obey. The teacher accordingly, should
be careful at first to command the child to move; since, if
necessary she can <i>force</i> him to move. She may command the
child to stand motionless because, if necessary, she can tie him
or put him in a straight-jacket. She should never, on the other
hand, command the child to "beg pardon," because the child
may refuse, and in the face of this refusal the teacher may
find herself helpless and lose her authority. To acquire authority
in command, the teacher must possess a considerable power
of suggestion; and this she can partially acquire. The teacher
should be physically attractive, of an "imposing personality."
She should have a clear musical voice, and some power of facial
expression and gesture. These things may be in large part
acquired by actual study of declamation and imitation, subjects
in which the perfect teacher should be proficient. The artistic
study of <i>command</i>, which the teacher may undertake, presents
itself under three aspects: voice study, gesture, facial expression.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Voice and speech:</i> The voice should be clear and musical,
word articulation perfect. Any defect in pronunciation should
effectually bar a teacher from the education of defective children.
On days when the teacher has a cold and her voice is
likely to assume false or ridiculous intonations, she should not
think of correcting or <i>commanding</i> a defective child. The
teacher's voice must be impressive and suggestive to the child.
If shouting and declamatory tirades have gone out of fashion
in the education of normal children, they may serve very well
in the education of defectives. Whereas, in the mental education
of these unfortunates, we are to pronounce a few words,
but very distinctly, here there is no objection to a veritable
flood of speech, provided such lectures be free from monotony,
the voice passing from tones of reproof to tones of sorrow, pathos,
tenderness, etc. A few words are to receive special emphasis&mdash;those
which we intend shall convey to the child what we wish
him to understand. The rest of all we say will constitute
for the child merely modulated, musical or painful sound. It
is in the music of the human voice that the elements of the
education of the feelings reside; whether in the prohibition
against doing something wrong, we introduce the corrective
command, or, in the order to perform some action, we include
encouragement, menace, or promise of reward.</p>

<p>Often the command is very simple. When the child is told
to do something, he does not refuse. Nevertheless he is not
easily persuaded. He must try to understand, first of all, what
we want of him. The technique of such a simple command
falls into two parts. We may call the first <i>incitement</i>, and the
second <i>explanation</i>. The whole command should be repeated
several times with varied intonations and with stress on different
words until each word in its order has been emphasized.
"James, put that book on the table." In the first instance the
command will be <i>incitive</i> in character, calling the attention of
the child to the action and urging him to perform it. Here
the accent should fall on the name of the child and on the
imperative. The tone should be that of absolute command.
"<i>James</i>, <i>put</i> that book on the table." As we pass from the
command to the explanation, the tone should be changed and
somewhat softened. The first word should be clear and impelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
followed by slow, insistent words&mdash;"James, put <i>that book</i>
on the table": "James, put that book on the <i>table</i>": "James,
put that book <i>on</i> the table." Thus the voice both in commanding
and in describing what was commanded, while urging the
child to perform the required action and guiding him to do it,
was also affording us help in its suggestive power and by explanation.</p>

<p><i>Gesture:</i> The teacher must study particularly expressive
gesture. She must always accompany what she says with gestures
serving both to impel the child to actions and which suggest
imitation and explain the command. Gestures should be
expressive enough to be readily intelligible even without words;
for example, if it is desirable to bring the child to perfect
quiescence, as the command is given, the teacher should stop,
become almost rigid, looking sharply at the child in such a way
that he may be impressed by that rigid fixity which he sees
before him and be brought by suggesting to imitate it. Then
to keep the child motionless, the teacher may attract his attention
by a slight almost continuous hypnotizing sort of whistle.
To excite an apathetic child to movement the teacher should
herself move, accompanying the stress of her voice with motion
in her whole body.</p>

<p>In the <i>simple command</i>, arm gesture only should be used and
as follows:</p>


<div class='hang2'>For <i>Incitement:</i> rapid movement in straight line.</div>

<div class='hang2'>For <i>Explanation:</i> slow movement in curve.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Command of <i>quiescence:</i> gesture up and down, from without
toward the body.</div>

<div class='hang2'>Command of <i>movement:</i> gesture from down, up, from within,
out from the body.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Facial expression and gaze:</i> The gaze has a powerful effect
on the child. It is the same gaze which impressed the child
and brought him to the first steps in his education (see our
chapter on the <i>Education of the Gaze</i>). All the expressions of
the eye are useful provided the teacher employs them properly.
It is not a question of scowling at the child to frighten him,
as might be supposed; but rather of bringing the eye as well
as the whole face to express all those emotions which the teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
must herself actually feel in the presence of an obedient or rebellious,
a patient or angry child; and of giving to this expression
such clearness that the child cannot possibly be mistaken
as to its meaning (Séguin, page 679). The teacher's face must
be expressive, mobile, hence in harmonious relationship with
what is to be expressed (calmness, gaiety, effort). The expression
must never vary momentarily on account of any extraneous
diversion which may occur; otherwise the children will soon
learn to provoke such distractions of the teacher's attention.
Such commands, which demand on the teacher's part so much
artistic study, will, of course, not be necessary during the whole
period of the child's education.</p></blockquote>
